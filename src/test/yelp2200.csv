I never used to be a department store shopper, but recently Ive discovered that nicer cloths just seem to fit better. Go figure. While I still like getting a deal, I usually wait until there is a clearance or sale or some type. The macy's at scottsdale fashion square seems to have more selection, such as more size options for the items you seem to like and a few more items to choose from also. For guys, I would suggest checking out the Dillards at fashion square; the mens dept is about the size of this entire macy's store. 2 or 3 times a year dillards has an awesome clearance event and you can pickup 65% off clearance prices; which are usually already 50 - 70% off the original price.

I digress; this is supposed to be a review of macy's. If you're in the biltmore area and looking for higher end quality shopping go ahead and check them out, then travel down camelback to fashion square mall when they tell you the item you like is only available in your size at a different store.",review,cRyNICH0mhjxagvSyVr60Q,1,7,3,Female

  The shrimp was okay.  A bit rubbery, but then what does one might expect for a seafood place in the middle of a desert?

My biggest problem with this place was the price of the food.  It is just too expensive for what amounts to frozen food plopped into a deep fryer.  I could buy frozen fish at the grocery store and then come home and plop it into my little deep fryer and it would taste about the same and be a lot cheaper.  

I just wish it wasn't so expensive.  Especially considering this in the hood.  If you know what I mean.  I don't mind driving down to the hood for some fried fish, but only if it is reasonably priced.",review,DBAg7I65F1lVwKU7UaScag,0,0,0,Female

We sat outside on the patio under a heat lamp. Enjoyed the olives as a starter, as well as some fried raviolis (yes, please) and a caprese salad app.  Outstanding artisan pizza, with as good a crust as I've ever had, and homemade mozzarella. Wine was just ok, but very reasonable. Server was attentive, helpful and friendly. Owner came by a couple times to check in on us and was absolutely delightful. 

Deduct a point for the proximity to the Handlebar J Saloon and the faux-cowboys arriving in limos with 10-gallon hats. Then add a point back for the near-fight we got to watch between a biker and the faux-cowboy who almost hit him with his Cadillac.

Then I was told that the food was not bad, but good!  Which only made me eye my table mates suspiciously.  I ordered the tacos al carbon which comes with cilantro lime rice.  these are three street taco sized dealies that have steak in them and come with a little shot of pico and queso.

Now like I said, I expected crap.  But the tacos, with pico and queso poured on them, and grease dribbling out into a glorious puddle on the plate, were really amazingly good.  The steak bits were really tender--ordinarily in such a taco they'd be the tenderness of jerky.  Really: the tacos were totally sensational.

Also, we ordered a buffalo chicken flatbread which is essentially a pizza.  And it was great!  even with the bleu cheese, which I detest, this was a culinary delight.

So why the four stars, you ask?  two reasons.  One: the cilantro lime rice is offensively bad, like straight out of a box of rice-a-roni bad.  I would have preferred kibbles and bits as a side item.

And one other thing: it was happy hour and for a while they were serving beer OUT OF PITCHERS THAT WERE IN THE REFRIGERATOR INSTEAD OF STRAIGHT OUT OF THE TAP!  Capital crime.  Felonious.  In fact, Dante wrote about a circle of hell where all they did was serve beer out of pitchers instead of straight from the tap.

So you should know that although the beer serving would usually be a four star deduction and I'd never look back, I didn't drink beer tonight and so I really don't care if my table mates suffer.  But if you try that shit on me...

Four stars.  The food is really damn good.",review,vhAn390OgR1H4DwacJdc7w,3,4,7,Male

They're pricing is usually pretty high on records/artists/genres that are popular or trendy.  That's pretty standard for anyplace.  The Ghost of Eastside keeps their prices slightly lower with more obscure selection.

However, the flipside is that Zia will overlook gems in their used stock and price them pretty low.  Probably because they don't know much about certain band line-ups, labels or releases in general.  I've found quite a few gems for two or three bucks in the used section.  

Used records are where it's at.  There is no rationale in buying anything new because they'll press those things in such high numbers that they're not rare anymore.  I'll still buy some new things from bands and such.  Not a lot.

Anyhow, I inadvertantly went to this Zia on record store day.  I was eating with my kids at that Chinese place around the corner.

I found a bunch of shit (not all rare but stuff I wanted): The Shit Licker's EP ""Cracked Cop Skulls (total early swede crust/dis), Orchid s/t 7"" on Hand Held Heart, The Automatics ""Golden Hits"" and ""Makin Out"", Chubbies ""Im the King"" 7"" on Sympathy, The Tie That Binds ""Adding Machine"" 7"", Gravy Train ""Hello Doctor"" LP.

There are tons of sit down expensive lunch places and lots of fast food (junk food) places too.  When I read the reviews on Chestnut Lane I hustled right on over.  The concept is right on but the execution leaves a LOT to be desired.  

First challenge is getting a parking place and I was lucky.  The line to order didn't look too bad when I arrived so i was feeling lucky.  However, the line took forever to move forward causing the people waiting to shuffle back and forth in a very confined space as there was lots of foot traffic trying to enter and exit.  The woman at the register took each order, processed the payment, and then proceeded to prepare the drinks  and sides for each order.  The drinks are somewhat specialty items and are kind of labor intensive, especially considering that the order line is at a total standstill.  SLOW!  After way too long a wait, I finally was able to order...then the real wait began!  It was a good 25 minutes before my order came up and it was just a TURKEY SANDWICH!  I felt lucky, though, as the woman ahead of me in line was still waiting for her SANDWICH after I had finished mine and was driving away!

Sometimes a long wait is mitigated by the awesomeness of the food.  Well, at Chestnut Lane this is unfortunately not the case.  I mean it was a decent turkey sandwich, but when I saw the almost $16 charge for a TURKEY SANDWICH and ICED TEA I was expecting something fabulous.  It wasn't all that.  

If you decide to go to Chestnut Lane, maybe you could park in the spacious Jack-in-the Box lot just to the east.  And grab a Breakfast Jack to hold you over during your long wait!",review,qNANO9sFNVPMPfuogtBZXg,2,2,2,Female

The other two at our table ordered from the Rokerij side and at least it looked a lot better. The two bacon wrapped shrimp were flavorful and my steak was over cooked for medium but OK.

We did not have a reservation, which would have helped us sit outside, but we were seated inside right away. The host was very pleasant and welcoming. 

Much has already been praised about this little gem, and I agree with all of the accolades regarding the atmosphere, the service, the food...it was all wonderful. 

We had the Fuego salad, which was huge and lovely (although I would have liked some diced onions on it; maybe I'll ask next time), the tortilla soup (husband raved about this), the Pulled Pork with cheddar chipotle mashed potatoes and maple-glazed carrots, and the panko-breaded chicken breast with creamed jalapeno corn and maple-glazed carrots. 

In all it was delectable. The entrees were succulent and nicely plated. I particularly loved the creamed corn, which was perfectly spicy and helped clear by sinuses (I succumbed to a bad cold the next day, so maybe I need some more!).

The only thing I would not order again is the carrots. I didn't feel these added anything to our dinners. The maple taste was pretty subtle, to the point of being nonexistent. Also, I think that if you're going to put yourself out there as an upscale restaurant, go the extra mile and use real carrots instead of the bagged ""baby carrots"" that you can find so readily on cafeteria lines. It will look better. 

Our waiter forgot to charge us for the soup. I pointed this out, and he comped us anyway. I will definitely continue to patronize an establishment that empowers its staff to make decisions like that without worrying that they're going to get a dock in pay.

Our friends ordered a spicy pineapple fried rice and a beef dish which I can't recall the name of.  All of the dishes were richly flavorful and had plenty of sauce to carry over to the steamed rice.

Went for lunch:   This time I thought the corned beef taquitos even  better than last, curry chips tad saltier.  Still loving the appetizers and the cider.  This time had the  cottage pie,  it's  really nothing to write home about, specially if you are from the region and your parent's wouldn't appreciate you seeing other cottage pies;)    Spend the extra on the sheperds  it's really much better.

Original Review:
 First thanks to Julie P for pointing out that this place exists. That it's within stumbling distance of the house ( think prolonged zombie stumble over an hour  versus a quick trip and recover)  is even better. 
Cider on tap is Strongbow and you get it in a real pint., Yay.  Sadly that's all they have and there's no bottled ones to try ,  Strongbow is  the Bud of UK ciders and while it's way better than no cider or what passes for beer here it's not that hard to stock more of a common drink for a themed bar. 

Onto the Food  (I'll get to it as a venue some other time)  
Appetizers.  Curry and chips was exactly what it should have been  and a generation of Irish and UK kids have  grown up with this for lunch  at the local chip shop.   
 
The  corned beef and cabbage taquitos  I think  are moving up to be our #1 appetizer that's not a hot wing. Taste of these  and the hot mustart / tomatillo salsa on the base compliment each other nicely. Not heavy on the fat and delightfully  crunchy.  For once an Irish restaurant trying to do something other than name US staples with cute regional names. 

Main: Salad   and the sheperd's pie. Let's not get into the salad it's a waste of time reviewing vegetables.  The pie is pretty good and none of the flavours overwhelm each other. Not sure the champ ( mashed potatos ) atop them live up to what lies below but it's more a personal texture issue than it spoiled the overall dish.  

Bread and Butter pudding is really good but please if you have any trouble sleeping after reading nutrition sheets as to the fat and carb content of your meal DON'T just  eat it and run round the  block four times before getting back in the car. 

Oddity?    parsley flakes on all the plates to make it green , please just buy green speckled plates , it's classier:D  At the end got a coupon for 25% off the next bill which I will certainly take them up on.

I used to go to OSF in Newport Beach, CA way back in the '70s, & I was somewhat amazed that they are still around & that there's one in Phoenix!

Stepping inside, this is the most junked-up restaurant I've ever been to!!!  Ok, except maybe Bahooka Ribs & Grog!*  It's a big place, with soft lighting inside, & rooms all over the place stuffed with tons of furniture, barrels, & so on, cluttering up every one of them!  It's all on purpose, of course, & my booth in the midst of all this craziness was actually completely ok.  (The floor elevation is up & down all over the place, too!) 

Ok, so for my first time (in about 35 years!) I just ordered the ""Pasta Classics - Rich Meat Sauce"", which is their way of saying, ""Spaghetti.""

Some good things:

*  I started with a cup of coffee, & it was excellent!

*  Pretty soon came a mixed lettuce salad, which was simple, but the Ranch Dressing was really tasty!

*  The next thing to hit the table was a little loaf about three by eight inches of hot Sourdough bread, with a cup of whipped garlic butter, all on a breadboard with a suitable knife for cutting it.  It was great!!

A couple of less wonderful things:

*  Some girl (from the kitchen?) brought my spaghetti before I was finished with my salad.

*  I thought the spaghetti sauce was ok, but not great.

Bottom line:  They give you plenty to eat here.  My meal included the beverage, salad (or soup), the hot bread, entree, & dessert.  It was nice & filling, & a good value at $9.99 for everything.    :-)

However, I've been going for dinner to Flavors of India for nearly three years now, and have ALWAYS liked the food. FOI is my first choice for Indian cuisine in Phoenix, out of the four other Indian restaurants in the valley I've tried. 

Yes, FOI is in a strip mall, but once inside, the ambiance is pleasant. It seems quite clean, I never got sick from anything I ate there (that's saying a lot, as I admit to being a fussy eater), and the waitstaff is helpful. Bollywood videos on the large flat-screen wall display in the corner are an unusual feature, but the volume is low or completely muted, so you can watch or choose not to, it isn't distracting.   (Here's a footnote about that: I ate at FOI on the night of the presidential primary election. My dining companion noticed that most of the waitstaff was gathered around the TV in the bar, watching electoral results, so he asked our waiter if we could watch too. After getting the enthusiastic okay from the two other occupied tables, it was quite late in the evening, silent Bollywood was replaced by live news coverage with volume turned on).

Regarding the food: I love their mattar paneer (cooked peas in a tasty curried gravy, with small cubes of homemade mild-tasting cheese).  My super-spicy friend gets the lamb vindaloo (super-spiced as he requests).  Tandoori shrimp, chicken and tikka masala are good though a bit pricier, the samosa appetizer (lightly battered and deep-fried cut vegetables) is fresh, warm and crunchy. Regular and garlic nan bread are everything they should be, biryani rice is overpriced (I'd stick with basmati rice as a side dish), and sweet lassi (a well-chilled dairy drink, similar in taste and consistency to a vanilla yogurt smoothy) is a nice treat. My spicy friend says his gin-and-tonic was weak, and they don't have ingredients to make a Bloody Mary, but hey, FOI is an Indian restaurant, so I can't fault them too much for that! 

Other pluses: open a bit later than many Phoenix restaurants (seating ends at 9:30 pm); very fast with takeout orders; there's lots of parking; the 16 North bus stop is nearby; silverware, glasses, white cotton tablecloths and napkins are always spotlessly clean.",review,8VikyrWXFKL8GU1a9t-o6Q,1,1,0,Male

The pizza just wasn't that good. It's just way too sweet. And when I say sweet,  it's so extreme that it overshadows anything else about their pizza.  It's so different in taste, it makes it seem like the wrong sauce was used. (I know it wasn't)

I am very glad to say it didn't end being the latter.  In fact, the food here was pretty damn good.  I did expect Saba's to be an order at the counter joint, so I was a little disappointed to see it was actually a tiny restaurant.  I like my Greek fast and cheap, okay?  But I got over it, got a table and began the interminable wait for our server to stop chatting with other diners and take our order.

The menu has all the normal Greek items, including falafel- little fried balls of joy I might add- gyros, vegetarian platters, spanakopita and dolmas.  Prices for the sandwiches and gyros are pretty cheap, but when you venture into the platter territory, you're going to pay for it. Platters start around $10 and go up.  I ordered the falafel, of course, and so did my boyfriend.  The pita sandwiches don't come with any sides, so we ordered a basket of fries to go along with our meal.

The dcor was pretty cool with big pictures of Greece all over the walls and the classic Greek music piped in.  Unfortunately, not even the Greek music could mask the hideous, loud tool of a diner that was sitting at the table in front of me. He was one of those idiots that has to talk so loud, even the half-deaf cook in the kitchen can hear him.  He was so loud I felt like I should respond to his questions.  Hey moron- saying things like ""I like it loose, like my women,"" is just not funny.

Anyways, when we finally got our food, it was really good.  The falafel pita and the fries were tasty, but our server sucked.  He obviously knew the loud tool, and kept chatting with him while we waited for our check.  That was a little annoying, but overall, Saba's is a good choice for a quick Greek meal.",review,0CMz8YaO3f8xu4KqQgKb9Q,5,5,4,Male

Yes, those two words matters so much to me. Rula offers 1/2 off all appetizers and discounts on pints. What could be better? I say try the brie, for it comes with an unbelievable apple chutney. If you're looking to split an entree with a friend, opt for the lamb stew - served with a side of soda bread. The stew is hearty and the serving is huge. I've also had the shepherd's pie, which was pretty tasty. Way too large for one person, though. 

Also, I discovered that Rula can make ya a Raspberry or Chocolate Guinness. I don't know how either tastes, for I went with a plain (but satisfying) pint. I asked to sample the concoctions, but was told Rula doesn't let people sample liquors. Fair enough. 

If I could change one thing about this place (ok, maybe more than one thing), I'd have a larger beer selection - even sold by the bottle. I'd also make it less noisy and crowded at night. If you don't get there early enough to stake your spot, you're likely to be standing the entire time. That doesn't make for a very comfortable experience. Word to wise: take advantage of Rula's casual atmosphere and leave your ridiculously high heels at home.

It's great that Rula offers live music. I wish they offered more. Sure, the outside patio is great, but what if I'm in the mood to play darts? I guess I'll have to go to another bar for that... and for the beer I'm really craving.

WORD TO NON-MEAT EATERS:
Try their veggie burger thingy - with mushrooms, peppers and such all heaped between two soft and delicious pieces of bun. Yum. It comes served with fresh, crispy and DIVINE 'tator wedges. These ain't your normal french fries, people. I STILL have cravings for them!

I think its because I went to the one in Ahwatukee a long time ago and didn't care for the food.  But I don't think they have the same owners since the websites are totally different.  But anyway, on to the review.

We ordered takeout and I was very impressed with how nicely it was all packaged and how quickly it was ready.  Also, the woman on the phone was very friendly, easy to understand in spite of an accent, and patient in explaining the menu items that I was unfamiliar with. All the appetizers sounded so good, we decided to get a bunch so the hubby and I could just pick at them since he was sick and didn't have much of an appetite.  However, the portions were bigger than expected so we ended up with quite a lot of food.  Lettuce wraps were very tasty, I loved the dressing on them.  Eggrolls were good but a little too much ""wrapper"" and not enough filling IMO.  Sweet potato chips were not what I was expecting, they were the white sweet potatoes that really don't have much taste to them and they were deep fried with I believe a panko breading on them.  A little bland but the sweet/hot dipping sauce they came with was fantastic.  I loved it so much I would order this again just for the sauce.  Also got some chicken soup for the sick hubby which I didn't try but he said was quite good. I threw in some pad thai noodles since that basic dish is always my test when evaluating a new Thai restaurant.  I asked for a four (out of five) on the spiciness scale and that was perfect for me.  I was very pleased at the heat level and overall flavor of the dish.  So many places hold back on the chiles if you are American, even if I insist I want it hot, and I have never understood why. The only thing missing was a squeeze of lime and garnish of fresh cilantro that I like on my pad thai.  Presumably you could get that upon request if you were dining in, it was no big deal to me since I had some at home.

I still prefer Yupha's as the best Thai in the area.  But I will definitely be back here for takeout because of the friendly, speedy service and convenient location.

There are aisles upon aisles of glorious, wholesome products (pun intended).  Everything is meticulously organized and there are at least ten varieties of every type of item.  No joke.  It took me fifteen minutes to decide which brand of bottled tea would be suitable (and economical). 

I roamed the freshly prepared food section like a vulture circling it's prey...strategizing which choice would be the best taste sensation.  Did I want a made-to-order wrap?  Or a glass of wine and a couple tapas? (the live music was alluring)...Maybe sushi?  Pizza?  Salad bar?  Soup? Maybe something from the smokehouse...oooh! A cupcake from the cupcake bar? 

On and on it went. 

My final decision was sushi. The spicy tuna roll tasted fresh, and the Pacific salad roll was very crisp. I also grabbed a container of ginger for $1.99--not the artificially preserved pink variety--all-natural pickled ginger.  Bliss.  I purchased some cucumber salad from the salad bar as a side/palate cleanser. All in all, a very satisfying meal. 

Prices are a tad higher than your average grocery store. Then again, it is Whole Foods. A word of advise:  come with a game plan (e.g. a shopping list).

Even worse, my chicken sausage pizza was slightly burnt on the bottom, and tasted bland and uninspired -- the sausage was finely ground and lacked much flavor, and the fennel was invisible.

Upon entering, you are enveloped by the aroma of pizza baking in a coal-fired oven.  This is swoon-inducing---and I mean that in a good way.  The smell almost has you believing that you are in a pizza joint with a coal-fired oven in the Northeast.

When ordering pizza baked in a coal-fired oven, I like to get a plain cheese pizza.  IMO, this is the best way to fully taste the sauce, cheese and crust without anything else get in the way.  

There's nothing like a thin crust pizza from a coal-fired oven with that char on the crust.  The crust has just the right balance of crispy and soft.  The sauce is well flavored with proper proportions of basil and oregano.  The amount of cheese is just right.  I love to savor each and every bite.

There is more to this Grimaldi's than the one under the Brooklyn Bridge.  This one has other items in addition to the pizza.  We like their antipasto.  It has sliced mozzarella which is fresh and creamy, black and green olives (the black ones are pitted, the green ones have pits in them),  roasted red pepper slices which are bursting with flavor, and a good, flavorful salami.

I walked in with my significant other and was surprised at how busy it was on a Tuesday night. At first, it didn't click but the entire volleyball team from a nearby high school decided to come so it was extremely busy.

They have some really good specials, but what really caught my eye was the specialty burgers that are $6. Big misunderstanding, most $6 are single patty and have some special toppings. Zipps decided to do a double-stacked specialtly burger. Yes, two 1/3 lb patties on a bun with some special toppings. We got two burgers and split them half and half, green chile burger and sweet jalapeno. Both were extremely awesome. You can get salad, fries, onion rings or half-half (half fries half onion rings). The fries kind of taste like In-n-Out fries, and my significant other would describe them as being better. I don't agree, and I don't disagree. Overall, good food, I can't wait to come back and try something else from their special menu. The $6 specialty burgers are available Tuesdays from 8-close and weekends from 11-4.

The service was really awesome. They definitely cared about us and went out of their way to make sure we were doing okay. I think they felt guilty that we were there when a huge group was there as well. Apparently, they also were understaffed, but it honestly did not feel like it. Seriously though, it was some of the best service I've ever had at a Phoenix restaurant. To top it all off, the manager had checked up on us a few times, and at the end after we paid the bill he brought us a cookie platter (pizzookie, or cookie with ice cream).

Now, I'm not a fan of pizzookie, but wow, their cookie platter was awesome. It wasn't on special that night, but I know its on special some other night and at $4 its probably worth a go again. Might I say one more thing about the cookie platter? It's just as good if not better than BJ's.

I am actually excited to go here again. With some really good food specials almost any night, I think if I ever run out of ideas this might be the first place I think of. The food is a little greasy, but I think that is expected when you go to a sports grill. Want to lose 50 lbs, go to subway.

I have had numerous irritating experiences at Jerry's.  In a nutshell...
I use red Prismacolor pencils.  I run out and go to Jerry's, they don't have them, don't know if they carry them and and nobody can tell me when and if they might reappear.  Why?  The (seemingly) canned answer is because the order comes from corporate, in North Carolina or somewhere far, far away where there is no phone or email access.  I go to buy Sculpey... OUT!  Same answer as to when it might return.  I need Faber Castell PITT brush tip markers...  OUT!  The same story with some airbrush materials. 
""Come back Tuesday or Thursday or just give us a call and we'll check if it's in...""   
I can walk to Jerry's in less than 10 mins but I would rather go to AZ Art or anywhere else than have to call everytime I need some stuff.  I can go to AZ Art in Tempe and when something is out can order from their mother store and it's there the next day.  

The clerks I have dealt with there are part of my rant.  Of the handful that I have dealt with, (mostly morning and daytime) it seems like they don't really know the store well or give a crap to give some insight on their products or company.
They do have a big store and I understand that there is alot of inventory to know about and be able to locate but that is your job.  It just seems like nobody that I have dealt with there is really keyed in on knowing their stuff.
I spoke to a gal there who was really chatting me up on her recent art night where she painted this huge piece and blah blah blah but when I asked if she knew when they might have more of the brush tip markers she was mum.   ""No clue.""

My only complaint about this place is on the weekends they usually have a cover band... not that the band is terrible or anything (i think they switch it up so it's  not always the same band anyway), but they're loud and if you're there to watch a game, forget about hearing anything relating to the game, including the people you are with.

Whole Foods Market.
Ladies, you're young and vibrant...today. 
But as the years drag on, you notice changes. Subtle changes, such as:

*crow's feet
*saddlebags
*sagging butt and or tits, 
*and orange skin from all the tanning products, your complexion now resembling that Louie V handbag you've been toting your Shitzadoodle around in.

You've got a choice to make.

Spend all your money now on organic, free range shit, this in an effort to remain healthy looking, or, shop for a lot of the same stuff at Costco, where you can load up, get twice your money's worth, and have a shitload of cardboard boxes you won't have a clue what to do with. 

But the real bonus will be how in only a few short years, you'll have saved enough money for a good plastic surgeon, which you're going to need anyway if you have any plans to remain living in Scottsdale for any length of time.

My opinion?
I highly recommend the latter and here's why.

Scottsdale has a serious shortage of fish-lipped women with feline looking facial features, who routinely wear yoga pants telegraphing their hiked-up thongs. 
Poor thong....how sad that your fate...to be cast to a fifty-something, saggy-butt host.
Ladies, is that what you want?
To idly standby, watching, as the ranks of this bass-cat looking oddity dwindle in population?
I didn't think so.

The choice is yours.
Beautiful and broke from shopping at Whole Foods today.
Or, aging not so gracefully with the help of medical science, an overzealous plastic surgeon, and Victoria's Secret, which I assure you with one of her thongs in yoga pants will be anything but. 
A lot of good all that free range organic crap did. 

If you do come here, try the hot deli, where you can get every kind of ethnic food, save for Ethiopian. It helps after a late night at work, on your way home, when you don't feel like eating fast food. They also have a taco and pizza bar, fresh bakery, and a smoked meats section where you can get some of the worst barbecue and smoked meats I've ever tasted. 
The only thing I'll recommend in this place other than the hot deli, is the chocolate and coffee bar, which seems to have a ton of delights that are supposedly good for you.

Love their steak with buttered plates. We've had it before where the streak wasnt cooked to our satisfaction. But after being there so many times I know how to order it. Sweet potato casserole is excellent. Cesar salad is the best I've ever had. On this occasion the wait staff was very friendly, but I've had it before where they are like buzzing bees. I usually like to have tea after dinner which is always nice. 

The atmosphere is good. It is nicer to sit in the main dining area near the windows instead of the side room.

Also people if you are going to spend hundred dollars on dinner, don't cheap out on a babysitter. Nobody wants to listen to your whinnying little brat kids who can't sit still. Ruth Chris should have an age requirement!

I've been to Mortons twice. Once in Chicago and once in Phoenix and both times it wasn't as good as Ruth Chris.",review,VNEqps27mp8-gTqTfzg7yw,0,1,1,Female

We've eaten lunch and dinner there a few times as well. They have a really good french onion soup, another soup I think was chicken pepper jack and the cobb sandwich is good. Their chicken fried steak is pretty good as well. They give you two decent sized steaks covered in mashed potatoes and gravy.
The bar is good as they have a great selection of beers. 
I also love their ice tea, it always hits the spot.",review,HP_xZYNC5XK-VyNrnHbtRQ,2,3,1,Male

The service was fast but I wouldn't say friendly. She made a few mistakes with our order-- gave my daughter a cheese pizza when we ordered pepperoni..  She put a glass right in front of my 22 mo old who grabbed it right away of course-- few other rookie mistakes like that. Calamari- gross. Lobster/crab tacos with white bland rice-- don't order it. My husband was happy with ribeye and atmosphere is cool and clean.,review,SLtSL-N1RfTcDUdW5I4z5w,0,1,0,Male

Whoa, you like to think that you're immune to Postinos, oh yeah
It's closer to the truth to say I can't get enough 
You know I'm gonna have to face it, I'm addicted to Postinos 

Thanks Robert Palmer and let's just say I wouldn't be surprised to see the fashion models around here.  Very attractive crowd!  I am honor just to be here!  

Another bottle of wine and you'll be mine, a one track mind 
I can't be saved 
4 flavors of Bruschetta is all I crave 
If there's some left for you 
and don't mind if I do 

I might as well face it I'm addicted to Postinos

I've always enjoyed attending Postinos on the West side of town, but the East side adds a new flavor.  The place still has a great deal on Monday and Tuesday nights.  Bottle of wine plus a large plate of bruschetta's for $20!  The ambience is always chill and low lighting.  Quite romantic and add some pretty ladies and I'm golden here!  Service is always great at Postinos.  The staff is definitely well train in the knowledge of wine and their service is spectacular! - Enjoy!",review,XqMkm-DD9VsdcKx2YVGhSA,2,2,2,Male

#1 Perfect fish and chips.
#2 One of the only correctly poured Guinness drafts in AZ.

They could punch me in the neck when I walked in, and i would still give them five stars for those two reasons.

Almost all the food is good (though I can count the number of times I've had anything other than the above on one hand). The happy hour is great, with half off appetizers, including the fish nuggets, which are the fish 'n' chips I eat before I eat the fish 'n' chips.

The world's most competitive trivia night. These people STUDY for trivia night. 

Great outdoor seating, good service. Decor is interesting, especially if you like this particular famous race horse that I currently forget the name of but is the subject of approximately 90% of the wall art.",review,XMEBJp8mmpz3vsSkvg9T9Q,2,2,2,Female
2194,h1kwVr1eTpBK0rWfcm5QSg,2012-04-25,vJ8Pz1HHH-srCcatKvx5Uw,2,"I used to frequent the Buffalo Wild Wings on Litchfield and Bell and never had a bad experience.  Whether it was fight night on a Saturday evening or a lazy Tuesday dinner, I never was worried about the overall experience at that location.

This location, on the other hand, could take some hints from there now defunct location to the west.  I have been to this location 4 times with each visit hoping the previous one was a fluke.  I always would get their flagship item as well, wings.  I like the spicy garlic which I find as the best balance between flavor and heat.  Each time the chicken was either overcooked, under sauced, or both.  Why can't they do their staple item right each and every time?  Major disappointment, times 4.

I won't elaborate on the other shortcomings of this location because they are too many.  The bullet points are that the service is very lackadaisical with anything.  You sit down waiting longer for the service to take your order than it takes to get it out to you.  On multiple occasions a buddy of mine who I went with each time felt compelled to recite Reservoir Dogs lines when it came to drink refills.  They were few and far between.  Finally, I don't sit at the bar because I like to speak with the company I am in, but that was virtually impossible.  This wasn't just on event nights either.  The volume of the speakers didn't vary anytime, not even in the middle of the week during lunch.

I want a good Buffalo Wild Wings in my area badly.  I have to travel to get to this location and would happily if they delivered on what I was used to.  I guess I am off to find another of the few that are actually still open until I see this location pick up its game.",review,Mwt1AlYH5p5eNss-2ai5OA,0,1,0,Male

The crepes are made to order, the ingredients are absolutely fresh and delicious.

So when you have the chance to find where they are and try them.  You won't be disappointed at all.  They are great.

They usually have coupons online and they take them from your smartphone!  The only gripe I have is that their bananas at breakfast are usually still a little too green to be tasty.  Although the donut muffins make up for it!  Recommended for all meals, but lunch and dinner are usually a little better.  Screw Flanders.",review,JEHGgY_fGtRCXur03C9fQQ,0,0,0,Male
