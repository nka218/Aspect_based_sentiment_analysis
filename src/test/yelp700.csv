From the bright decor to the delicious food to the amazing service (I mean everyone who works there actually looks like they enjoy their job and are having a good time!) this place is 5 star.  

I love the cozy lounge feel and could easily see myself enjoying several hours of delicious cocktails and conversation with friends.  This would be a great spot for dinner, drinks, or even an event (another Yelp event please!).

Highlights:
Tasty drink menu
Fabulous wicker tables and trendy IKEAish style
Great part of town

Sending it back and trying something else is what I would have liked to do, but the server never returned to check on us until my family was finished with their meal.  The owner did apologize and asked us to give them a try again.  Maybe I will, if the staff gets some training.  Everyone seemed completely overwhelmed.

My friend had a killer salad with buffalo chicken and I had a tremendously delicious burger with avocado, jalapenos, and salsa.  They were able to accommodate my desire to skip the fruit and veggie sides and go all waffle fries for me.  When I asked for dipping sauces beside ketchup, I got three choices.  I would only complain that their water glasses are far too small, especially for some of their spicier dishes.  I think the expectation is that you have cocktail to help you wash away some of the heat.  Speaking of their cocktails, the martinis, which I have had on a different occasion, are quite good.

I find myself hesitating to go there now because of the atrocious parking situation. This place is an absolute zoo on the weekends and when I can't find a parking spot by the restaurant, I find myself parking in the surrounding neighborhood worrying that my car may be towed when I come out! 

Needless to say, their homemade English Muffins are amazing. I really could just survive on those happily for the rest of my life. The grape preserves on the side are fantastic as well...and I don't even like grape preserves! That, paired with their coffee, makes for one of the best breakfasts in the Valley. And, if you're splurging? Go for the salted chocolate chip cookie if they have it. It makes me happy just thinking about it. :-)

This place is great if you have a weekday morning available to come here..or an hour or two on the weekend. The little shopping area is great to browse around - when you can figure out a way through all the people in line! Don't get me wrong..the food is fantastic. I just like a little more relaxation on my weekend than fighting through the hordes just to get that amazing english muffin. It's worth it, but then I just feel tired.....annoyed. And that's really not how I want to start my weekend off. 

If you can....call in the order for Curbside Pick Up. That way, you can enjoy LGO without the frustration of finding the mythical parking spot, standing in a long line (albeit trendy) and searching for a table with everybody else so you don't have to eat the wonderfulness standing up.",review,wB7YiVcqEWyL7arlVLsa-g,0,0,0,Female

I find Quiktrips to generally be the cheapest gas in town. Sure, the Arco sign down the street might say it's 2 cents/gallon cheaper, but then you get whacked with the ATM surcharge, not to mention there's all those bums loitering in the adjacent bus stop.

With Quiktrip, the place is well lit, there's always a trash can and window squeegee at every pump, the convenience store is better than most, and unlike most other gas stations, they don't charge you for the air compressor. Oh, and the person at the register will actually greet you when you step inside the door, while managing to sound sincere about it. Is that the coolest thing for a convenience store or what?

Matta's has an upper level where every table is set up like a balcony over looking the main level, it feels like your in a courtyard. The only thing it's missing is an open look at the sky. There was also a mariachi band playing during the night which added to the appeal. And to make things really cool (at least to me), they did a Mexican version of the Godfather theme song. Loved it! 

The chips and salsa came out right away. The hot had a kick to it, but wasn't very flavorful. The mild was excellent, but I prefer my Salsa hot. I tried combining the two, which was only okay. The menu isn't really anything special. It's a lot smaller than most Mexican restaurants, and is loaded with the standards. My girlfriend had a chicken burrito which she enjoyed. I had the chicken fajitas, which were good as well. The food was good, but not great enough to make me run back out. 

The service was excellent. Our waitress was on top of everything despite the fact that we were on the upper level. We watched and felt a little bad as she had to run up and down the stairs (she usually took the stairs that weren't as visible, but you know what's going on) to get everything for us. I could imagine that if a server were having a bad enough day, they would just make people up there and wait. 

We just randomly chose Matta's because we happened to be at Mesa Riverview. I enjoyed my experience there. While it's not a place that I'm dieing to try again, if someone suggests Mexican, and we're nearby, I'd recommend it.",review,thdVzCfKx-DV0zYWqId3pw,0,1,0,Female

My hubby and I have been missing this place since it closed its original restaurant in Cave Creek. We heard it moved to Phoenix and we found it and went there this past week. Unfortunately, it was nothing like the old, hopping, smell good, smokey, fun filled environment of the original SF. 

I can see that they have a lot of regulars and the barkeep knew everyone that walked through the door, which to me,  was very cool, but it just wasn't gelling for me this night I suppose. 

We ordered the deep Fried green chili's and there was soooo much batter  on them, I had to really concentrate hard to find the chili. I ended up peeling all of the batter off of the chili's just to get a small bite. icky. 

I would give this another chance just because I hate writing a bad review.

618,vZBYSQtTbY9MaYu5qNuU8Q,2008-02-01,s6Gx6KvpjEdbNK_yYVSyhw,5,"Piestewa and Camelback Peaks are the two boobs of Phoenix. They're real, and they're spectacular. 

Of course, being all-natural one is just a slight bit larger than the other, but this is barely noticeable. Camelback is barely 100 feet higher than Piestewa, whose nipple... er... summit, is at 2608 feet. Climb either one and you can enjoy great views of the other at various vantage points, not to mention views of the city. 

Although Camelback strikes me as a funner climb, I give Piestewa 5 stars because for what it lacks in the intangible fun factor it makes up with being just a tad less insanely crowded. Piestewa Peak Park also has a number of really cool looking trails that don't go up to the summit, which look to me to be worth exploring some day.

Speaking of female body parts, the former name for this peak was ""Squaw"" Peak. This has inspired one of the most ridiculous controversies in modern times in our state. Native Americans are offended by the term ""Squaw"", and regardless of the linguistic origins of the word, it is basically the equivalent of terms such as ""Negress"" or ""Jewess"". In the 1990s, the State of Arizona proposed ending the controversy by renaming the peak after our greatest political leader ever and the father of American conservatism, Barry Goldwater. The whining dipshits who apparently constitute our voting population rejected the idea. They'd rather continue using a stupid name that has no historical or sentimental value whatsoever just to spite Native Americans, rather than honoring one of their finest citizens.

And so, in this decade, Democratic Governor Janet Napolitano put an abrupt end to the whole issue. She gave the sqaw-apologists the finger and ordered the renaming of the peak to Piestewa, after Lori Piestewa, the first US woman soldier to be killed in the 2003 Iraq war and a member of the uniquely-Arizonan Hopi Nation. A fitting end to the debate.

NOTE: Even more fitting, the original name of this peak was Squaw Tit Peak, and I swear to God I'm not making that up to be funny.",review,17PPxx8RxjOUD_nQZ1aHEw,5,6,11,Male

I love how big it is in the Marquee, because it allows for tons of people to see a great show. One thing that most venues fail at is keeping it cool inside of the venue, The Marquee on the other hand does a tremendous job of keeping the temperatures bearable in there. 

The only thing I hate (and this has nothing to do with The Marquee itself) is that I am always standing next to belligerently drunk, annoying girls who can't seem to keep their mouths shut during a set.... Please don't speak... I am listening to Chris Carrabba's angelic voice, thanks.

Andiamo....

FOOD
--------
Appetizer: Fritto Misto, which is a trio of fried appetizers. For the day, ours included a cheese, a stuffed olive, and whole leaves of broccolini. The cheese wedge was great (I wish I remembered what it was), and have you ever had a deep fried veal-stuffed olive? Very interesting. The flash-fried broccolini took a little getting used to, since the leaves kept crumbling as I was trying to eat them, but still tasty, if subtle.

Main: Orecchiette alla Puttanesca. Man. This is the real deal. Orecchiette is the ""little ear"" pasta and ""alla puttanesca"" means it's made ""whore style"". 

And what a beautiful, classy, yet very vibrant whore she is.

The pasta was cooked just perfectly, and even though puttanesca sauce usually goes with a stringier pasta (spaghetti, linguini, etc.) it worked really well with the orecchiette. 

And the sauce. Holy mother, this streetwalkin' hussy of a sauce with its 12 ingredients: capers, breadcrumbs, anchovy sauce, garlic, olives, basil, olive oil, and, uh, the other 5. The flavors were a perfect, clear-heeled harmony. Nothing overpowered the other. Subtle and humble home food. It really tasted just like something my Italian friends' mothers would cook in their kitchen.

As for the servings, when I first got my bowl I was thinking, ""oh ok, this is a European serving. I'm still going to be starving after this."" And, um, nope. Why? Because I slowed down. I savored my meal, and took my time with the dish. And by the end, was I hungry? Not at all. I really enjoyed this meal. And the serving was just right. Complimentary packs of long breadsticks are also found on each table. 

SERVICE
-------------
Very friendly, efficient, and willing to go through the menu in detail and answer any more questions about the restaurant. Dishes were brought out in a timely manner and there was never any rush after the meal was completed to clear the table. 

And the mood inside Pastabar was palpable. Everyone looked happy, excited, and relieved that the restaurant was finally open for business. And I felt the same for them. 

SETTING
-------------
I would say the space was just the right size. Not a cavernous place in the least. Probably the same size as Sens, maybe  even a little smaller. It's tucked away in the very back of the hallway of the building, so much so that I completely missed it when I was IN THE HALLWAY the previous afternoon looking for it. But I like it a little hidden off, actually. 

The colors inside are warm, with a modern bistro feel. No windows looking outside but I didn't mind that. There is seating at the bar, a few two-tops up front, and larger tables in the back. Selections from different Shins albums made up the soundtrack throughout the dinner, and while the music sounds like it could be incongruous with a bunch of little ears cooked whore-style, it worked. 

I definitely don't think this is going to be as ""scene-y"" as Sens. It has a completely different vibe. 

EXTRA CRIB NOTES
-----------------------------
* the main courses of Pastabar are pasta and ONLY pasta. No veal parm here. And no hoikey sauces like Olive Garden-y alfredo or a jar of sugary Prego.
* It's great
* Prices for antipasti range from $7-$11-ish and mains $11-ish to $18. I spent around $26 with tax and a nice tip.
* it's great
* No liquor license (yet). For now, sparkling waters, lemonades, a number of sodas (including root beer & cream soda). 
* it's great
* complimentary valet awaits the diners, if you're averse to parking close by yourself.
* it's great
* It's open till midnight on weeknights and 2 am on weekends! What more could you ask for?
* did I tell you it's great?

ALL IN ALL
---------------
An awesome asset to the area and I'm very content. And as much as I loved my whoreish little ears, all the other pastas on the menu sounded incredible and I can't wait to try them all.

Kohl's Department Stores.....Brewers spring training...... 

Yep, I'm a cheesehead. (But if you EVER actually catch me wearing a hunk of fake foam cheese on my head, shoot me. Really.) 

What can I say? I like Culver's. It reminds me of home. It's total comfort food. 

Got one of their Wisconsin Swiss melts. What other fast food joints offer burgers with Swiss on rye? The crinkle cut fries are always hot and fresh. And tasty. 

Culver's is known for their frozen custard. What Wisconsinite has not driven past a Culver's, looked at their sign, checked out the 'flavor of the day', and gone, ""Hey, that sounds good!!"", and quickly pulled into the parking lot? 

If you're from Wisconsin or the Midwest stop in for a Butterburger and some custard....it will bring back lots of good memories. 

Like another reviewer noted when he said he felt like he was in Iowa or something.....well.....that's the whole charm behind Culver's. You DO feel like you're in Wisconsin or one of the upper Midwest states. 

Granted I'm not the best person to review Culver's....I'm a little biased towards it. But if you want a 'different' kind of fast food experience and you've never been to the upper Midwest, it's a heck of a whole lot cheaper than flying there.

If you have low expectations you'll expect a bored teenager who hands you a price sheet and stares at you looking bored.

Walking into the Total Tan I had pretty good expectations based on the reviews and even those were blown away.  Dallas was the person who helped me (I think he's one of the owners?) and he was sooooo friendly and knowledgeable I spent more than I was originally planning but I feel good about it actually.

I had looked at the pricing online so I had an idea of what I wanted but he explained things about the beds that I never knew and that none of the other salons I'd been to had ever told me.  He was super personable too, even asking for my name just during his explanations of everything before I had committed to buying anything.  He made sure I knew every detail of the beds, the differences, gave recommendations and was never pushy with any of it.  During our conversation several people came in and he always asked my permission first to take care of them and I don't think he had to ask for their names once, a good sign that he pays attention and remembers his customers.

I could go on and on because I was so impressed with his service and also the location itself (super clean, trendy, nice extras in the rooms like baby wipes and extra towels) but I think you get the point by now.

However the crab empanada was my favorite! YUM!

She didn't pressure us one way or another, and left the room so that we could talk privately and make our decision.

Once we made our difficult decision to put our kitty down, she brought the cat into a private room with us so that we could say goodbye.  She left us alone and gave us as much time as we needed.  She also let us be present in the room when they gave her the final shot.  At all times the doctor and the techs were compassionate and very respectful.

Well, don't so quickly dismiss the other absolutely AMAZING dishes served here!  It may look like a little pre-processed Japanese hole in the wall from the outside, but they're a die hard home-made mom and pop your mouth full of great food establishment!

I'd highly recommend trying the Katsu bowl! You can hardly find ANY kind of Japanese katsu in AZ, yet they have an excellent one that's very traditional, but not too expensive! I'd love to explain the mystique of this dish, but too many people think that fried egg with onions and leeks topped over a diced pork cutlet that's coated in panko bread crumbs is too strange to be palatable.  Well, to them I say you should educate your tongue, and expose it to some delicious culture! 

There's also Orange chicken... This dish is completely the bee's knees. It easily and without remorse makes Panda Express look like a burnt out oil can that a homeless person decided to cook some chicken in over a pile of burning newspapers.

Their house beef? Spicy garlic brown sauce and beef with mushrooms? Heaven.  Simple and delicious.

And I haven't even mentioned their coup de grace yet.  Their fried rice might seem a little ""heavy"" on the surface as it's lightly fried with some garlic oil, but it outclasses all competitors.  Paired with their lightly fried shrimp, it's sweet garlic love.  Seriously, their fried rice is the Sean Connery of fried rices.

I decided to try it out anyway, was seated by a friendly waiter and ordered the hot & sour soup (they were able to sub in chicken instead of pork - bonus) and the waiter recommended the house chicken to me. I asked for it to be made really spicy, knowing full well it wasn't going to be (no one EVER listens to me when I demand the food be spicy - listen, dammit, I'm brown, people). Anyway, that's my issue.

The hot & sour soup arrived, and it was excellent. I was happy. Nothing mars a Chinese meal more than beginning it with a bowl of shiteous soup. Then came the house chicken (with string beans added for $1). Steamed rice costs another extra buck - I get annoyed when Chinese restaurants don't make it complimentary, but again, my issue. Anyway, the chicken was just ok. Nothing amazing and it still ended up feeling pretty heavy. So that dish I'm more willing to give it 2.5 stars. 

So why did I bump up the star wattage? I guess the service. 

The waiter:

* noticed I wasn't devouring my dish and offered to switch it for any other dish of my choice, no extra charge. Who does this nowadays - in a Chinese restaurant no less? Extra star.
* is from the SF Bay Area like myself, so he gave me the lowdown for good Asian food in Phoenix (for dimsum he recommended Golden Buddha first, Great Wall second, C-Fu third - then for Vietnamese he recommended some place on 19th Ave between Indian School & Camelback.) He agreed that Thai, Korean, and sushi in Phoenix is kind of a letdown compared to California, but almost all the Asian restaurants (he admitted, including China Chili) cater to their core customers, who by sheer demographics are pretty much not Asian. That said, he told me that China Chili is THE place people go to for Chinese food, including Chris Bianco (of Pizzeria Bianco), the mayor, folks from Channel 10 news, the owner of the Diamondbacks, etc. etc. So take that for what you will.
* When I asked if this China Chili was affiliated with...""oh, the one in Fremont? No. But people say that place is good and fancy and has an electric piano."" Bonus points for knowing that.

Anyway, he recommended I come back and get the Mongolian beef next time, which I'll definitely do, plus the hot & sour soup. I didn't mind the big open seating area - many Chinese restaurants in SF are like this, loud and raucous. 

All in all, China Chili is a case where service overcame the food (again, how often does that happen?) to come back and give it another shot.

The selection is staggering.  I remember the first time I stepped in, I was amazed.  The only movie I really wanted to see and they didn't have was The Helstrom Chronicle, but that's okay.  I'm not going to ding this place because they didn't have it.  ""You didn't have The Helstrom Chronicle?  Lame!""  I mean, come on.  No one else has it.  

This place had it all, from little indie films to gross-out horror films I had long forgotten from my disturbing adolescence (Cannibal Holocaust, Faces of Death, etc.).  They even had the worst movie I'd ever seen in my life:  Hard Rock Zombies.

The décor is that of sheer, unbridled love for cinema.  You can easily spend hours and hours browsing through their selection.",review,mym5tXZoZCbuPCYQzI5Ysg,2,3,1,Male

Occasionally, I have stopped into Mill's End for breakfast, specifically because they have crepes on their menu; in fact, their breakfast menu is actually fairly extensive for a small cafe.  For reasons explained below, lately I've found myself just walking past Mill's End, no longer considering giving it my business.  The general issues that I have with this place involve just a couple of basic things; if the owners made the effort to correct these, I believe Mill's End could be a great cafe.

I have always thought there are three factors that can make a cafe stand out from its competitors.  It is with all three of these that Mill's End falls short: 

1)Ambience.  This means that the environment must be suitable both for studying/reading, as well as relaxation.  So, the music playing needs to be something that is non-intrusive and that the customers can generally ignore; sometimes Mill's End has this covered, but other times not at all.  Onto the seating.  It seems that this cafe was decorated back in 1995, in an attempt to capture the coziness of the cafe on the TV show ""Friends;"" unfortunately, they didn't come close, but there is usually plenty of seating open.  By the way, what is up with pseudo-sexual ice photography on the walls?

2)Price.  This is actually my number one problem with Mill's End.  The coffee is reasonably priced, but the food is too expensive.  Anytime I tell someone that I ate there, it's always the same response, ""yeah, their food is good, but it's really pricey.""  Considering that this place is literally ten feet from a major light rail stop, I imagine that their business has gone up, but those prices sure haven't dropped.

3.Customer service.  The staff has always been just lukewarm.  Look, I don't expect the staff in cafes and restaurants to be smiling like idiots all of the time, I only want to feel welcomed with a bit of hospitality; this has just always been kind of lacking at Mill's End.

Honestly, I think this place has a lot of potential, but it seems to be awash in complacency.",review,ykg3-2C-8Vv3K4mVj1iSfA,1,1,0,Female

We started out with the spinach artichoke dip. The blends of cheeses made this perhaps the single most spectacular dip I've ever had the honor of putting in my mouth. O.M.G. Venyse and I were practically clawing at the bowl to get the last of its creamy loveliness. But when you hit a home run so soon in the game, the rest of a meal can seem at odds.

However, I was not daunted. She ordered the New York Strip with a side of mashed potatoes (with good gravy...what exactly is that?) and roasted carrots; I the blackened Mahi [*back story to follow] topped with crab and a side of Israeli couscous. We didn't share our protein, but we sampled each others sides. All were very good, but the carrots really stood out. The gravy and the potatoes were good and I loved my couscous. But halfway through here steak and by the last few bites of my fish, we both hit the wall. A food coma was certain. I persevered but Venyse relented and boxed the rest of her meat and carrots.

Then came the white chocolate brownie. So sweet, so rich, so topped with vanilla ice cream. It was all we could to to make a dent in it. We both felt bad, because isn't white chocolate supposed to be their signature ingredient? 

Regardless, this was a terrific first restaurant to go with which to begin. And we both agreed it would be a place in our future dinner splurges. I also must admit I love LOVE the belt buckles. Having about 42 myself, I was intrigued when I first noticed what I thought read ""SWAG"" after staring for perhaps too long in that general region of one of the staff. (Really super sorry if that creeped you out.) It's actually WCG.

[* When a group of us went to Key West one December to escape of the harsh winter of NWOhio and Detroit, we went to a restaurant the listed ""Dolphin"" as one of its menu items. I asked in a slightly shocked voice if it was really dolphin, to which the server responded it was actually Mahi. 'Oh,' I responded. 'Then I'll have the veggie burger.'

Place was busy, but we were able to get seated immediately as it wasn't totally full, and even being not at capacity, it was insanely loud. Naturally I expect a beer bar to have a relatively high volume but this place was ridiculously loud to the point of being annoying.

The beer selection was good though I'm not sure that makes up for the loudness and atmosphere that seemed a bit off: really brightly lit, and the decorating was of the signs-bought-new-but-made-to-look-old variety. Almost like a Bennigan's, kind of fakey-like. And why oh why does a place that specializes in beer and seats so many people have just a single urinal and single stall in the tiny men's bathroom?

Our first experience with the new management and staff wasn't great.  Service was slow, but we figured they must be busy so we let it slide.  Then we bought stuff from the market.  They have two registers side-by-side--one for the market purchases and one for the restaurant bills. We went to the restaurant register so we could pay for our market purchases along with our meal.  First of all, we got ignored and had several customers taken before us, despite the fact that we were there first.  When they finally decided to acknowledge us, they told us we couldn't pay at that register since we had a market purchase.  Rather than just sliding over to the next register and taking care of the purchase there, they made us wait in line again.  Finally we checked out...and were overcharged.  We didn't realize this until we got home and by then it wasn't worth going back. 

We decided to give them another chance and went back a few weeks later.  This time the service was even more slow. 15 minutes passed before we even got our water.  45 minutes later our food still hadn't arrived.  The waitress kept speeding by our table and ignoring us.  We snarfed our food down fast when it finally got there since we had to get back, and went to pay.  Long wait again as we got ignored for other customers who came after us, and then they overcharged us.  Again.  Fortunately we caught it this time.  They hastily made the correction, without so much as an apology.  Rather, they acted annoyed that we were holding them up.  How about getting it right the first time if you don't want to do it again? 

So that was it.  I don't think we'll be going back.  It's really a shame, because the food is  delicious and this used to be one of our favorite places.  It's just a shame that the new staff sucks.

The old one was far larger and would have been about where the Starbucks is now. Of course, I'm talking about 1973 here, so I digress. . . .

Anyway, the current abbreviated Duck remains one of my favorite places to relax and hang out in Phoenix. Now I have a little one who enjoys running through the grass near the patio and socializing with the other youngsters that frequent the place. The bar features interesting wines by the bottle and glass. Most nights the by-the-glass happy hour special is something rather interesting, in contrast to the ""red"" or ""white' found in other joints. The interior of the small bar is dark like a cellar. In fact, you can find a variety of atmospheres in and out of the Duck.

And the sandwiches! Yes, try them all. Very, very good.",review,nDBly08j5URmrHQ2JCbyiw,1,1,1,Male

I went in to fill up as I usually do at any station unaware that I was paying TEN CENTS MORE PER GALLON (than Circle K)  because I wasn't paying cash or using a Shell credit card.  Yes, there are signs on the pump but, really, who would think to look for such a requirement?  I've been buying gas for over 40'years and have never seen such a non-cash penalty.  I, and my children, their spouses and our friends will not be getting gas there ever again.  How disappointing and dishonest.",review,Aj7Gx0gmjb-tX9tJ4IvqKQ,0,0,0,Male

This hotel was built in the 80's and the grounds are above par.  They have a 3 level pool with a bar in the middle.  Works for me!  The golf course is  really nice.

I go for the veggie soup normally, since I'm a bit leery of the raw meats and strange meatballs you can get.  Their vermicelli is also quite edible.

Service could be a little quicker.

Bring cash if you're spending less than $5 - with pho and water you will pay 3.50 + tax.  Cheapest lunch in town.",review,8h5EXsiEuK5_igQ0cgxPZQ,1,2,1,Female

My boyfriend has a 1969 Pontiac Firebird that hasn't run in several years. After sinking lots of his own time into tinkering with it and $1000 to the awful Meineke down the street, he gave up... until my car's transmission went for good, and he decided to fix the Bird (yeah!) so I could drive it (yes, I am super lucky!)

Whitey's diagnosed it as the carburetor dumping fuel (which is what Meineke charged $500 to replace.. hmmm...). Upon hearing the story of Meineke, Whitey's told him to order the part himself to avoid the markup and they'd put it in for just labor.  Awesome!

We took it home, but it wasn't running quite right still, and then failed emissions. Back to the shop it went.

Whitey's took it back, spent ALL WEEKEND on it doing various minor things. At one point, they called and said ""We've done this, this and this, and it's still not quite right, so we're gonna keep it another day.""   I was glad they were admitting they actually felt it to be not right and were determined to fix it, versus just handing it back again... but I was dreading the repair bill.

We picked it up Tuesday. The bill? $7. That's right - SEVEN DOLLARS. They only charged him for a spark plug and oil filter. That is amazing to me - I was expecting several hundred dollars for their time.  

The car runs beautifully now, and they were extremely pleasant the entire time. I'm taking my alleged defunct car to them for a second opinion next week. I HIGHLY recommend Whitey's!",review,ysINNe8YpbOW_-5T5CSyhw,1,2,1,Male

Signature Roll
Squid Salad
Yellowtail Collarbone
Drinks, Drinks...drinks.

They have a little karaoke room, and full bar you can make use of as well.
