I try to avoid WM.  I'm always warned about the possibility of TB or now, pig flu.  I think the hub just doesn't want to go shopping--not that I LIKE shopping.

I know someone who worked WM in WA and she says the conditions are just horrible for employees.  I've spoken to at least one cashier that is actually FRIENDLY and LOVES his job benefits and bonuses.  He's a minority I guess bc as you all said, YOU CAN'T FIND ANYTHING and CAN'T GET HELP without attitude, usually.  

I'm standing there staring at 2 mgrs, and they just ignore me for a few minutes?  I didn't want to interrupt the conversation, so I waited.  FINALLY, one asks if I need help???  NAAAAAH, I was just admiring your huge body and wondered how long it might take me to look that way.  FOOLS!  

On my last visit, a customer said ""excuse me"" to the 3 employees behind me in the aisle.  I glanced at her and she sighed, rolled her eyes and shook her head as they all ignored her.  I chuckled and acknowledged her frustration.  Then one employee pipes up with ""OH, I'm sorry ma'am, can we help you?""  She asks to find an item, the customer thanks them, they say ""You're welcome"", the customer leaves and they sarcastically continue to each other: ""THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR.  NO, THAT'S NOT WHY WE'RE HERE.  We're not here to find stuff for stupid people, we have better things to do.""    That's why, when I walk by an employee working, if they lay eyes on me, they immediately look away and pretend to be engrossed in their job, to avoid stopping to help.  WT?  What's wrong w/this management???  

I agree, you can find some deals and save some money, but the attitude is over the top.  There are a FEW employees that actually smile and appear friendly, at least when I see them, and I can point them out.  If not for the more often than not occurences as mentioned above, I stay OUT of WM as much as possible, which is a lot.  I've drastically reduced my trips there, but more importantly, I've cut out a huge chunk of purchasing from WM.",review,4muLyMlTP1ijRLACBBRcaQ,0,1,2,Female

I ordered the two fish combo, and my reaction was...what the..?..are they serious? 

1.) The ""chips"" suuuuck. No salt, overcooked and stiff. I couldn't even eat them. 
2) The two squares of fish I got were alright, but I may as well have gone to Safeway and bought a box of Gorton's fish sticks. 
3.) The red ""special sauce"".  Wtf? And you have to pay extra if you want tarter? Lame.

We got a small caesar salad, a small pepperoni and garlic, and a personal white pizza with roasted red peppers.  A few minutes later we got our salad.  It was really good.  Just enough dressing, lots of cheese and croutons.  It was a good starter.  A few minutes after that, our pizza came out.

Anyways, spent time in the bar which was nice, the bartenders were willing to answer questions, though not always the most chatty, but I think that was due more to how busy it was then not being friendly. The happy hour prices looked pretty good, $2 hot sake, $3 beer, $4-5 cocktails. Sushi was also on the cheap, Nigiri was from about 1.25-2 dollars I believe, and the other rolls ran from 3-5 dollars at the worst. They also have some non-sushi appetizers on there. 

Once we got a table, we were paired with another group, which was actually a nice experience as I do like the communal type seating stuff. Granted if you have a small group and not a fan of eating with strangers, might not like it much. 

Since it is a place I always consider more about a show then the food, going to start with that first. The show was eh, they do some of the knife play stuff, and a few things here and there, but honestly it wasn't all that exciting compared to the other place I've been (Sakura). The chef was friendly though, and the server was personable so that is a plus. Otherwise was a bit disappointed with the show portion of the meal. 

As for the food, I had the Filet Mignon and lobster tail. The filet was supposed to be medium, but came out more medium well in my opinion. It was lightly seasoned, leaving mostly a beef flavor then anything else. Now it had a good beef flavor, so by no means complaining just like a bit more seasoning personally. The lobster tail was good, buttery from the butter, but more importantly nice and sweet. How it is to other lobster tails? can't really tell you as I don't eat it that much (college students don't exactly have that sort of cash you know? =P). But again thought it was good, wasn't fishy and nice and sweet. 

At the end it came with a choice of ice cream, I tried the green tea ice cream which about the same as any other green tea ice cream I've had. Basically its sweet, with a hint of green tea taste, and that is about it. 

They have to sing to you of course, and they take a picture which they give you with a code you can access for up to 60 days (I believe) to download it, which is a nice touch.

This restaurant has been here for 38 years.  I've been going here off and on for 35 years.  I go here more for sentimental reasons, and not so much for the food.  

The interior still retains some of the original decoration style from the original restaurant established nearly 40 years ago.  The rest of the decorations have been torn out.  I believe the decor is modeled after the Forbidden Palace in Beijing - see the vault-of-the-heavens style crenelations in the ceiling.  

I have this restaurant - in its former self - to thank for this:  Back in its day, this restaurant was really great, and the entire atmosphere lent to an ambiance that actually inspired me to study Chinese and then later go live over there for some years. 

Sadly, the food here is not all that good.  The fryer oil they use here is pretty old.  The fried rice arrives looking almost black (from the fryer oil?  too much soy sauce?) instead of a rich golden brown, and tastes overcooked somehow.  The eggrolls are just OK.  Definitely not fresh.

A lot of the menu items from the original owners are no longer on the menu; for example the special ""Chinese cakes"" served on a plate topped with a delicious gravy-like brown sauce and shallots - probably some form of Cantonese food.  All of this is gone, and replaced by very plain fare, and not very good at that.  

If you like salty, greasy, plain-tasting yet somehow edible Chinese food not far from the $1-per-scoop variety, then go here.  Golden Phoenix's heyday as a great restaurant is long-gone.

2622,eTbtfgUtfewdncgVf2CbWw,2012-09-16,UIUfEDc62fpMxWCW3Lc5PQ,5,"Owned and operated by Eugenia Theodosopoulos (an Ohio native, fyi) and considered by many to be the best patisserie/bakery in the state I approached Essence with a note of skepticism largely assuming much of the hype was derived from Tempe's plethoric college crowd but arriving at the doors of the small shop on a particularly lovely 80 degree morning I gathered quite quickly that my original conceptions were misplaced; not only does Essence not look like a college haunt, neither do its prices or products - a vast selection of at least twenty items aside from the posted menu sitting beneath and atop a glass case forcing me to make more than one tough decision that was not helped by my server's accurate assessment that everything was really good.

Now bearing in mind that the original impetus to visit Tempe on this particular morning was to visit Caffe Boa and that Essence was more of 'pre-meal' activity what follows may seem slightly gluttonous, but to be fair once I took my first bite of Theodosopoulos's École Lenôtre trained almond croissant I knew I was in good hands and everything else just sort of followed.  Without a doubt my favorite breakfast pastry and perhaps my favorite French pastry overall, Essence's $3 twice baked option arrives slightly smaller than the average but with a shell that crackles to the tooth and an interior that is at once yawning pockets of air and nearly overloaded with butter and light frangipane there is no doubt that this is a case of ""big things in small packages,"" and particularly in its still-warm morning state the flavors and textures rivaled those at Dominique Ansel and Payard Las Vegas for best I've had stateside.

Moving next from the baked goods to one prepared from the menu my second taste of the morning aside from the slightly earthy and lightly leather accented coffee was Essence's ""Signature"" French Toast, a $7.25 selection featuring three griddled slices of eggy brioche and a sidecar of what I can best describe as banana infused caramel.  Rich but thinly sliced and therefore nicely saturated each piece of the French Toast was exactly as it should be - the exterior crisp and the interior custard-while the sauce provided a pleasant balance of fruity notes and intrinsic sweetness that complimented rather than overwhelming the bread.

At this point submitting to the fact that I was going to eat even the items I'd bought 'for later,' my next two tastes were a pair of $2.95 macarons that, much like the croissant, rivaled those both here and abroad in terms of taste and texture while opting for a much more rustic approach terms of size and presentation.  Beginning first with Pumpkin Spice and then proceeding to Vanilla with Dark Rum each palm-sized cookie was exactly what one would expect from a well trained pastry chef as the exterior shell provided a slight crackle on bite subsequently giving way to a soft meringue followed by dense cream that slowly dissipated on the tongue - the cinnamon and nutmeg notes of the former particularly notable while the rum in the second was appropriately understated thus serving to highlight the vanilla of the shell.

If there were any 'misstep' on the morning, it *might* have been the ""Summer Berry Croissant Bread Pudding,"" though when I say misstep I must temper the comment with the fact that my quibble is only that I prefer the French/English take on the dish while this one was more based on the French Custard style, a rich vanilla bean pudding without a lot of crunch or textural variance but instead laden with blackberries, raspberries, and strawberries plus a sidecar of lightly sugared strawberries.  Focusing more of the natural sweetness of the fruits and aromatics of the vanilla than the typical overly sweet versions served stateside it was more panna cotta than bread pudding to me, but chalking that up to personal tastes it was still delicious.

Moving last to the one dish that gave me trepidation, the ""French Napoleon"" gave caused pause not only because the name clearly skewed towards a subset unfamiliar with a proper Mille-Feuille but also because so many pre-made versions of this layered pastry have failed to wow in the past...thankfully this was not the case at Essence.  Featuring light and crunchy layers of choux easily withstanding the tines of a fork without turning into a smooshy mess (see ""Mille Feuille New York"") intertwined with rich pastry cream speckled with dots of vanilla bean and ripe raspberries what truly made this version stand out was the manner in which Theodosopoulos caramelized each layer of choux, a technique reminiscent of Pierre Herme and as good as the French icon's version was I'd be hard pressed to say Essence's was any less impressive.  It would be awesome to see what they could do a la minut like Savoy, L'Arpege, or Genin and given the names I've dropped in the paragraphs above plus Essence's proximity I've no doubt I'll be returning to see what else the small shop is capable of soon.",review,5lq4LkrviYgQ4LJNsBYHcA,2,3,3,Female

We were each responsible to lead a team of volunteers in a different community service project and per my passion I chose the Humane Society. We arrived on Sunday afternoon with a group of 12 people at the Campus for Compassion on Dobbins Rd. Kathy - the head of volunteer services - met with us and gave us a thorough introduction. She included the history of the AZ humane society and the process and procedures by which they take-in and shelter animals. She really focused on promoting spaying and neutering pets and cited some very impressive statistics. Did you know that over 7 years un-neutered  cats can breed to reach 420,000 in numbers??!!!! and dogs 67,000??!!! thats CRAZY and so compelling. 

Kathy proceeded by giving us a very educational tour of the facilities... we saw dogs, horses, cats and bunnies. It was very eye-opening. First off it shattered any stigma you have about a shelter. The animal accommodations are so impressive!! The dogs have BIG size kennels with indoor and outdoor spaces that are really spacious. I was nervous to go in and see the dogs in kennels but I really wasn't as heartbroken as I thought I'd be bc they really had nice size spaces. 

There are sprawling lawns in the back where animals can run and play which even include a public dog park! There are also private puppy rooms.  The cats have big crates as well and even private bedrooms where they can hang out in groups and the facilities were squeaky clean w/o any odors. 

The volunteers were so nice, kind and devoted to the animals. We got to feed horses, play with cats and bunnies and put together leashes for dogs. The most encouraging thing though was that the place was busy on a sunday! buzzing with people wanting to adopt pets and several cats were actually adopted during the 2 hours we were there.

I could sit in a theater all day, all week, all year long and do nothing but gaze at live performances of theatrical talent. lol! Well in actuality, hmmmmmmm I really could. I am not even joking on that. I probably would if someone brought me water every now and again. LOL!  Ok, seriously now, Childsplay is my favorite organization in Az for a host of reasons. 
   My dear friends of Childsplay know who they are. This is children's theater at it's best! The Q and A sessions after each show is a plus. The kids love it. I have to admit I do too since I get to go say hi to my friends after each stage-show. I also learn more techniques that I can steal when I teach drama to my inner city students. Teehee!  ( Yes I am a teacher and yes I would die to have some of their costumes and sets) 
   I have seen so many wonderful plays, literature remakes, and original scripts performed At TCPA and by Childsplay. Fernidad, BFG and New Kid were only some of the most amazing masterpieces I have had the distinct pleasure of viewing from these talented actors. Debbie, Scott, Katie, Jodi; well all of them! LOVE YOU!
   Childsplay also has an artist in Residence program for schools. We have had an artist at our school for several years. It is wonderful to note that the teaching techniques classroom teachers are learning are helping tomorrows future. Time after time I have seen struggling kids blossom under their tutelage.  
   Of importance to note, TCPA is a beautiful facility. You can enjoy a nice venue along with the superstar talent. What more can you ask for?  
   The only negative I can possibly imagine is that in today's hard times the cost may be inhibiting to some families. But if you like them on Facebook they sometimes have discounted tickets and contests to win free tickets. A great way to start viewing them and get involved.
    I do hope everyone continues to support the arts here in Az. As I have stated in my other ""ARTS"" reviews, I do worry about cultural program survival in Az with recent state budget cuts.

I took my man here for ""mystery date night"" as a surprise since he had never been.  No wait at 8:45 on a Friday night (yes! take that Pizzeria B) and the atmosphere of this house is super intimate and cool.  I love the atmosphere of the patio also, lit with those great off-white lights, and fire pits.  We shared the burrata which was gynormus, easily enough for 4 people or a hungry us.  The wine was tasty and reasonable.  I was drinking a pinot grigio, and my guy had the house chianti which I never usually order anywhere since it almost always reminds of grandmas table wine - until I tried Cibo's house version.  It was very good, definitely not from grandmas!   Now for the pizza - it is just perfection.  It has that amazing combination of char on the crust, crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside with the right balance of sauce and toppings.  It almost melts in your mouth, it's not heavy at all.  It's nice to go out for a pizza dinner with and app and dessert and not feel like you have to roll yourself out of the joint!  So we finished our romantic mystery date night with a crepe filled with nutella, ricotta, AND a scoop of ice cream on top.  I don't typically die over dessert, it's my boyfriends thing.  I'm an app girl - but this, it wasn't too sweet, it was so gooey and delicious and the ice cream added just the right amount of sweetness.  I would never eat here without dessert again!  

I have been for lunch and they can get you in and out in a little less than an hour, but they don't fire up the pizza oven till supper which is why I prefer that here.

The ingredients were all fine; most seemed fresh, but I had to avoid a couple of the less popular offereings (for the life of me, I don't understand why bok choy hasn't captured the hearts of the American public). The sauces were generally tasty...think Trader Joe's bottled dressings and you'll get the idea.

Ruling: It's OK and a worthy stop in Scottsdale for a pre-dinner beverage. 

Sure, I could front load my review with spicy adjectives, overinflated superlatives, some forced humor, and throw on an added star and hope for a ROTD (come on, don't pretend that you don't know the formula), but I am not selling my stars for a day on the big screen. 

If it's been said once, twice, and even thrice, need I repeat it? Yes, because it is true -- this is not Postino, and for that matter, this is not Kaz. It is a good, local spot to grab a glass of wine, maybe even with your mom, who may not be hip enough to chill at Postino on Central (which really requires little hipness, I mean they let me in), or your dad, who may not be able to read in the dark at Kaz, or maybe for that friend from Gilbert, who you know, wants to walk the wide straight path of predictability. 

Predictability isn't bad...in this case, that means a good wine selection (could rotate more), full bar, usually one good draft or two out of 5, decent cocktails, and decent food. The food is not really what you come for. The bruschetta is sub par, but the salads are above par. And, I have to add, hummus with no flat bread or pita?? No. No pita for you! 

Service runs from friendly (read, management) to disillusioned and inattentive. The latter tends to happen if you sit outside. The last time I was in, I think grapes were crushed, olives were pressed, and chickpeas were ground...at least they could have been. 

Often they have live music too, which runs from the somewhat awkward jazz guy who keeps talking to you to the Motown wedding singer -- which on at least one occasion brought out near Elaine Benes-style dancing -- now that was worth the visit and waiting for the grape crushing.",review,0NckJhx0qXykvvhsm-p7MA,2,3,2,Female

So, I wasn't too hungry this time, so I decided to order from the small plates menu.  We started with the corn fritters.  Then I ordered the shrimp and grits and my husband ordered the hibachi steak.  

The only reason I didn't give them five stars is because we didn't get our appetizer until the our food was ready.  And by that time, we had already stuffed our faces with bread and butter (which is delicious)!  The server apologized for delay in bringing our app and the manager came by and didn't charge us for the corn fritters.  That was much appreciated!  We only had one of the fritters since our other dishes were in front of us and we didn't want those to get cold.

The guy who answered the phone said that due to a downed gas line in the area they couldn't operate, but their Mesa store would deliver to me for no extra charge since I couldn't come pick it up like I wanted to. I said this would be fine, placed my order, and the guy said it would be about 45 minutes. An hour and 15 minutes later the food still hadn't arrived, but I figured it was just because it was coming from Mesa. 

When it finally arrived, I was starving, so I opened the food immediately, only to find out that my Panang CHICKEN was nothing but sauce and a few carrots and bell peppers. On top of this, I had been charged a delivery fee when they said I wouldn't, and I was charged for chicken when I got none. I called back immediately to tell them my food did not have any chicken in it, but was only sauce and a couple vegetables. They informed me that they were very busy and would not be able to bring me another order that night, but I could call back the next day (today) and they would bring me another order. I was upset and hoped that for all the trouble the food was at least good. Well, it was. The panang sauce was very delicious and perfectly spicy. Although it was not made the way I ordered it, I could still tell that it was very good and I would definitely order it again. 

Today, I called back and they brought me a new order, this time of Spicy Eggplant with chicken since I had already had to eat the panang I ended up with last night and didn't want that again at this point. They were very nice about making it right, and they delivered it to me again at no charge and credited back the charge they made last night. Delivery took about an hour and 15 minutes again even though he had said 45 and this location is about a mile from where I live, so if you order delivery expect a bit of a wait. As for the Spicy Eggplant with chicken, it was REALLY delicious. The eggplant tasted like some of the best I've ever had, not mushy but not firm, and I finally got my chicken and yes, it was very good. SO in conclusion, the food is great but I hope that they are more organized when they aren't having technical difficulties. Probably won't have them deliver again but I would definitely order from here again.

Really... it was almost not edible.  The packaging was not great, so it kind of spilled a bit in the bag - not a good start.

Perhaps the curry is the 'yellow curry' that Jenny R refers to in her review - maybe the chef should taste it before serving it - it was nasty!

Seriously, I've had better Asian food from the food court at the mall before!

I will say, you did listen to my request to add eggplant to the dish - thank you... but if someone requests eggplant, perhaps you should make sure it's cooked fully next time.  I had a bite that was barely cooked - it was crunchy.  

So, needless to say - I don't think I'll be giving you another shot.  First impressions sometimes last a lifetime.  Sorry Banana Leaf!",review,fczQCSmaWF78toLEmb0Zsw,7,14,5,Female

From scrambling eggs to grilling a piece of meat the new Rico's American Grill at the Point Hilton Squaw Peak Resort shows that all this can be done and more on a daily basis. 

With two massive patios, a large bar and lounge area coupled with a fantastic selection of locally made beers on tap, just beckons you to try them all out. This is easily done by ordering up a Beer Flight ($7) which gets you 4 5oz glasses of their best brews, though this will be tough to chose, they're all good. Then you can order a capped 64oz growler ($20) to go! A growler is simply a large glass jug filled with your favorite beer, your choice. These are all the rage in other cities so I was excited to see Rico's making this offer. Id fill it with my latest favorite, Left Hand Milk Stout Sweet Stout. Think rich flavors of chocolate and coffee blended with milk sugars to give a sweet and creamy taste. 

In the large dining room you'll notice a wood fired oven. Unfortunately Rico's doesn't take full advantage of this, only offering a handful of menu items cooked in it including the BBQ Chicken Flatbread ($12). Covered with pulled chicken, red onions, Rico's BBQ sauce and mozzarella, this paired well with our beers though could have used a bit more salt, easily remedied. Another glimmer of what could be was the Wood Oven Baked Penne ($13). Several large meatballs, roasted tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella and pesto ricotta cheese and al dente pasta made for a hearty satisfying meal. 

A bit lighter but bold with flavor, the Chopped Salad ($10, add grilled chicken $3) made with grilled corn, black beans, bacon, tomatoes, cucumber, avocado, and BBQ-ranch dressing was shaken, not stirred, literally. The salad is brought out in a large martini shaker, dressing added on the spot then shaken well. Kind of a neat twist on table-side salad service, what's old is new again. 

The Wicked Meatloaf ($15) could have used some of Rico's BBQ sauce for a sweet contrast instead of the semi-boring-more-like-brown-gravy cracked pepper demi. The meaty slabs were paired up with roasted garlic mashed potatoes that were well seasoned and comforting.   

Perfectly cooked and perfectly tender, the New York Strip Steak ($21) had a warm poblano and bacon relish that I could have eaten by the spoonful. The smoky sweet relish made the need for any sort of steak sauce not necessary. Along side was a heaping helping of green chile mac 'n' cheese, so creamy and so gone, delish. 

Apple Skillet For 2 ($7) takes apple slices simmered in a brown sugar and cinnamon, thanks to the wood-burning oven, then topped with cake crumbles and served with cinnamon vanilla gelato. If the skillet weren't so hot I would have licked it clean. 

While Rico's may not have yet achieved culinary greatness, what you do get is solid Southwestern influenced American grub.",review,lPaYMDmJbAnv_3pmZH_inw,2,4,0,Female

I had purchased an online deal because I've always wanted to do something like this and thought it to be a great gift for my other half. I sent her a message and she quickly responded. Almost everything I needed to know for the shoot was emailed to me. You have the opportunity to do your own hair and makeup or have someone she works with do it at a reasonable rate. I highly recommend that you get it done by her ladies. That day I saw Erica. She was really fun and got me into the mood (the glass of wine helped too :-) ) and she did an incredible job with the makeup and hair. For those who feel a little nervous I do recommend bringing some wine along with you. It really loosens you up a bit and allows you to be more comfortable. It was perfect since my first photos were the nude shots. Note: wear loose fitting clothing, nothing elastic and be sure that you do not have a sunburn on your body. Let your hair air dry and it is OK to put on your own serums and moisturizers prior to the shoot. Make sure nothing with sunscreen gets on your face and while it's not necessary, I made sure to use a primer. I thought it really helped out with how my makeup set. Be prepared to pose in positions that may be a bit awkward and also note that you will likely be sore the next day from the different twisting that you have to do. Jodi really knows how to make you feel comfortable and at ease. I don't make a habit of being in the buff in front of complete strangers and for me to drop my robe without feeling shy was a big deal for me. It helped that I had my own music mix on my iPod throughout the entire shoot as well. The overall whole experience was incredible. I felt sexy and confident.

It seems like a great idea.  It's a build your own burger joint, $7.00 gets you a cooked to order burger with one cheese, up to 4 toppings, and 2 sauces with fries or onion rings-or some other choices.  They also claim that the beef is local, hormone free, etcetera....

I chose a rare burger with American, grilled onions, sauteed mushrooms. tomato and lettuce, with mayo and mustard on a potato bun.  I added bacon for a dollar.

First, let me point out that if you are in a hurry, DON'T GO HERE TO EAT.  I waited exactly 39 minutes for my food. This would not be a big deal if:
1.  I had been warned before they ran my credit card--what if I only had 30 minutes for lunch??
2. They had places to sit but it's tiny and full.
3.  They had magazines, a jukebox, ANYTHING to entertain you for 39 minutes.  You can't even get your drink early to sip on that.

At the 30 minute mark, I'm ready to eat cardboard with a little ketchup on it, so maybe they make you wait so everything tastes even better?
Anyway, before my burger comes up, I notice that the lady behind the counter is saying that the orders overwhelmed the kitchen.  I look in the kitchen---they have ONE GUY TRYING TO DO ALL THIS??????   He'd better be getting a share of the profits!!!!!  Now I'm jsut feeling really bad for this guy back there.

I finally get my burger!  YAY!!  I'm SO excited!  All those 4 and 5 star reviews!  I take a bite and....the patty shoots out the other side of the bun like it had been shot out of a cannon.
WTH?  I look at the patty.  It's clean as a whistle. I mean there is no mayo or mustard or cheese smeared on the patty.  I turn it over and it slides out of my fingers back into the basket.  The other side is clean too.  The freakin' burger was so greasy, it slid all over the place!  Then a greasy glop of what must have  been the mushrooms and onions slid out.  Still not seeing any cheese, mayo, or mustard anywhere.  Just oil.  Tons and tons of oil.  I open the bun,  On one side is a heavily oiled slick of lettuce glued to the bun by (I am guessing) a slice of cheese.  The other side of the bun has some mayo and mustard residue--and more oil.  I'm grossed out, but hungry.  I take a bite.  It's not rare,  It's well done and oddly, tastes very faintly of liver.  BTW, remember the bacon I paid a dollar for?  Not there.  I'm really puzzled that instead of cheese. or beef, or SOMETHING, I just taste that faint livery taste. So I take another bite.There isn't even any salt or pepper, or anything on the burger patty.  This is perhaps, the worst grade of meat available for human consumption.  I take a third bite because that second bite brought back a memory of when I worked for a meat company here in town.  Now I recognize the flavor.  I'm not saying that what I ate that day at Two Hippies was old dairy cow, but that's EXACTLY what it tasted like.

At this point, I turn to the fries.  The are shriveled and DARK and taste like they've been fried and then microwaved.

I couldn't get out of there fast enough!  Forget my danged dollar!  just get me in the car!

So, this morning I stopped for gas. My tank was getting dangerously low and there was no way I'd make it to work. That's okay, for I allotted time this morning for re-filling my tank. From my casa, I turned East on Indian School, vaguely remembering there's a Quick Trip nearby. Perfect. I had stopped there before. 

But it wasn't a Quick Trip I saw at the corner of Central and Indian School. Not wanting to risk running out of gas, I opted to stop here, at this ampm station. 

I pulled up to the closest gas tank, got out of my car, took off my gas cap and reached for the gas nozzle. Only then I discovered there was no pay-at-the-pump option. The short notice on the pump said to select my grade and start filling. ""Wow,"" I thought, ""It's so odd for a station to trust people - especially in this area - to not drive off without paying."" 

So, I followed the instructions, but nothing happened. I kept hitting the grade button. It kept beeping back at me. Still nothing. To top it off (no pun intended), the nozzle was wrapped in this huge rubber tube thing that compressed when I applied pressure to the handle. I had never seen anything like it. 

Thinking my particular pump was fuct up, I pulled my car up to the next one. That's when I saw it - this strange machine, like an Amtrack ticket dispenser. I approached with curiously. That's when I realized. You swipe your card at this central machine (or deposit cash, if that's your preference) and then go back to your pump. Ah-ha. This is how this station works. So, I did just that. I punched in my gas pump number (4) and went back to my car to re-fill the tank. Already annoyed at this point, I figured I'd pump enough gas to get me through the next couple of days. 

Only, it wasn't pumping. The long rubber thingy was hindering my ability to hook the nozzle up to my gas tank. UGH. So, that's when I flexed my muscles and applied enough pressure to squeeze out $12 worth of gas. Then I re-hooked the nozzle on its perch and walked back to the strange machine for my receipt - it told me to do so when I swiped my card. Only, no receipt came out. I punched the keypad with defiance and walked off. 

Stupid ampm station. Since when does any gas station benefit from being different? I'm so used to pay-at-the-pump; you just swipe your card, select your grade, pump your gas, grab your receipt and go. Quick Trip doesn't torment me like this. There is no rubber nozzle thingy in my way. Grr. Screw this. I'm never going back there again.

I for one will never go back. I'm really sad too because I decided on it from the reviews. Another reviewer said they were disappointed in the recent quality. I should have listened!!,review,A8e50wVP7xcz1sWOE6gEbQ,0,3,0,Female

They were efficient, friendly, proactive, highly-responsive, and helpful. I especially appreciated that they kept me updated on the progress of my automobile and advocated for me/my vehicle when needed. This level of high-quality customer services is hard to come by. If you have a choice, choose Harvil's. You won't be disappointed.",review,g3maenY9AgoZ6koLJZibpw,0,1,1,Male

You will not see any dough-nuts being made here which is sort of part of what the Krispy Kreme experience should be. Seeing them being made; ordering them as they come out so they are still warm for your first bite.

Now then let's consider this review then as if this was a regular dough-nut shop and it also does not stand up. The mom-and-pop  shop I have closer to me makes better tasting ones, but it is probably because they make them right then and there.

I am assuming that they are hauling the ones they do sell here from a different location or a centralized place where they make them, which completely explains why the glazes, etc. taste as if they have been sitting for a while. They are still ok dough-nuts.

The other thing that this place lacks is in the coffee. I ordered a coffee and the person had one of those Super-sized Shamrock farms half-and-half containers and asked us if I'd like some in my coffee and to tell her when to stop. I am sorry but, who puts anything on their coffee without even tasting it first. Not me that's for sure. Worst experience getting coffee here.

Bottom line: The dough-nuts here will not be what you would expect from Krispy Kreme and forget about ordering coffee that will be to your liking.",review,V3ITtKg7jkHNWOU0aod7eA,0,1,0,Male

There is no denying this is great pizza,  All of the ingredients are delicately chosen and prepared by the man himself, and he manages to pull flavors out of each that should not be humanly possible.

If you live in AZ you owe it to yourself to try it at least once.  Steel yourself for a long wait, however, 3 hours isnt much if you've got friends and wine with you,  just dont get too drunk to taste your meal when its finally time to eat.",review,9v-aHckN0L0r_7pC2Azvrg,0,1,0,Female
