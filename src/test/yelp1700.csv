I chose the two burritos with chicken meal that came with rice and beans.  Standard, but fulfilling rice and refried beans.  The burrito was a breath of fresh grilled veggies.  A warm tortilla filled with chicken, peppers and onions.  So simple and yet so mouth watering.  Best part was that the burrito was so big that I got to save the second one for my flight back to SF.  Oh, and this whole package was under $7.",review,-OMlS6yWkYjVldNhC31wYg,1,1,0,Male

Yet, as I followed in from one slot to another after spending a lot of his money down the drain. I noticed that not only did he not get any winnings, but no one around was winning either during the entire time he played. Really?!?! Not only was he in the hole, but many others. Very ODD that I noticed this. Also, no one was working the floor asking anyone if they'd like a drink. Perhaps, I may be used to how Vegas does it?

I'm curious for other feedback from other attendees at this place. Have you had any winnings?

Elegantly Casual American describes Tonto. 

Indeed it's pricey, but the food is fresh, creatively presented and delicious. (Extra pluses for using locally-sourced ingredients) 
I enjoyed the Mexican white shrimp tacos. The petite shrimp comes drenched in a sassy ancho chili green pepper sauce, complemented by a cool and zesty cabbage-carrot-cilanto slaw, avocado cream sauce and chewy homemade white corn tortillas. The fun is getting to assemble your own tacos. I ate nearly every bite and was stuffed for most of the day. 

My companions enjoyed the Reuben sandwich (layered corned beef on crispy rye, served with skinny fries that don't need ketchup) and the Halibut served on potato cake with spinach and carrot salad. Grandma-in-law said the halibut was tender and flavorful. I can imagine a bunch of friends or foodies mingling and laughing, sipping wine in relaxed delight as you drink in the beautiful view.

A few tips:
1. Get there before 6pm. The park closes the entry but if you're in, you can stay as long as you want. 
2. Be ready for a drive up a mountain -- scary cliffs and tight corners. Make sure you go slow, watch for hikers and cyclists, and overall be cautious.
3. If you're heading to the summit for the views (Dobbins Lookout) bring a jacket or blanket. It's cold and windy when the sun goes down, even in the summer.

There are bathrooms but no water fountains at the Lookout.",review,nSLrExcVVphiNzvSf5H7vA,1,3,1,Male

The interior is modern, spacious and very comfortable. The design is not only admirable, but also very broad. Inside the restaurant there are various types of seating. Tables, counters even plush chairs to chill and kick it with a glass of beer or wine among friends. There is an outside patio too.

The first thing you notice during breakfast is a fifty cent cup of coffee. This is a bold brew in a paper cup and plastic top. Excellent coffee. For my morning meal I order Chloe's favorite, a six dollar 2 scrambled eggs, 2 slices of bacon, toast, wedge of fruit, plate. The swirled marbled rye bread crafted at John Anthoney's Italian Bread Company was perfect. Potatoes sauteed with fresh chili peppers were tip top. Bacon was thick and so good.

This is one of the areas newest restaurants, and even has a few groceries. Fresh ready to go pre-made lunches, fruit, wine, beer and soft drinks. I would love to recommend at least one bottle water that would come in a paper carton instead of plastic. I took home a bottle of Le Village, Sparkling French Limonade, tasty.

Also a big thanks to Malalay, a super svelte, very friendly gal that not only poured the coffee and brought the food, but laughed with me too. And ^5's to my cook.

While having just stopped in at the Ranch Market to pick up a few groceries, I was going to eat at the Market itself but decided to maybe try a place I had never tried near by instead. As I took my groceries to the car, I decided that since I had not yet tried ""Tradiciones"" I would give them a try. 
I enjoy the food at the Ranch Market-- tasty and authentic.  Since they are connected I THOUGHT the food would be the same. Boy was I wrong!  I don't know who they have cooking here, but with all the great stuff they have next door it should be A LOT better. 
The salsa should have been the first clue...it was just ok.  Again, knowing what they make in house next door, made this salsa pretty sad.  Wanting an Agua Fresca to drink and again knowing next door had like 7+ varieties, I was disappointed they only had horchata and pina here. I got the pina, which was probably the best part of this meal. 
I was really craving some tacos, and noticed they only really offered them under the appetizer menu as street tacos. Also wanting to have a sopito, I thought WTH I will get the sampler platter and add a taco. 

The platter came with 2 mini chimis, 2 mini taquitos, 2 mini cheese enchiladas and a soptio each of chicken and beef. All looked good when it came out. I enjoyed the taco first...the last thing I was to enjoy on this culinary outing. Then, digging into the chicken enchiladas, the sauce was a ""mole"". This was not a good mole...way too sweet, someones idea of a mole. Yes, just because a mole has chocolate doesn't mean it's a chocolate sauce.  And the chicken, stringy bland kinda tough. Everything followed suit, bland not very authentic, someones idea of mexican food. It all reminded me of something I would get if in the Mid-west somewhere and wanted Mexican food...not Arizona! 

The only saving grace to this meal was that it was happy hour on a Saturday and the platter was 1/2 off and the taco was a buck so I left paying only $9 instead of $15. 

While I will continue to eat at the Market....I will pass on TRADICIONES...*blegh*.",review,usQTOj7LQ9v0Fl98gRa3Iw,2,2,2,Female

Not only were the ingredients fresh and delicious but the price was reasonable as well. 5 of us each had a scrumptious & generously portioned sundae and our total bill was less than $20!

I was expected a glass full of fruit as is customary and there was one tiny lone piece of peach clinging sadly to the bottom of the glass.  The waiter was kind enough to swap it out for the passionfruit sangria which I enjoyed much more.  I also tried the blood orange mojito and the coconut mojito.  They were both fabulous and LARGE!  If it were up to me, I'd make them slightly less sweet but they were still fantastic nonetheless.

The tour is not really much of a tour, but more of a 20-25 minute lesson on growing and harvesting olives, and then a look at the equipment used to press the oil. Our tour guide was very entertaining and funny. While there was a long period of standing, there is very little walking so really anyone can get their $5 worth.

While waiting for the tour to start, we wandered around the store and then enjoyed the wine and cider tasting outside. They also have live music every Saturday. 

After the tour we filled several sample cups with a variety of olive oil flavors, and bought a loaf of bread, and enjoyed figuring out what was in each cup. The line to order food was too long, so we didn't stick around for a meal, but everything looked wonderful. 

The only less than positive thing I have to say is that they really promoted the Pork Shop down the road, so we went there hoping to load up on ready made food (since we had opted not to wait in line for Olive Mill food). It's actually a butcher shop that also sells a few cooked items. There were BBQ pork burritos, green chili burritos, and spare ribs. The pork burrito was alright, but the sauce overwhelmed the meat so that's all you could really taste. 

The ribs were really a disappointment. They are around $6-7 a pound, and although they were meaty, it took way too much work to get the meat off of the bones.

There were lots of people so it was a little overwhelming for her but she loved it.  Both of us are just coming down from our sugar high.  

It was great to see Gabi and Lindsey manning the Yelp booth and our very own Thomas S. helping with emcee duties!

I helped myself to both salads, and picked up a sandwich, intending to dismantle it and eat the meat and cheese.  Inexplicably, I took a bite of the sandwich, and said ""OMG!  This is so good!""  It was the turkey w/bacon and avocado sandwich.  My friend seated directly to my left said, ""Let's go to Bertha's and order more of these after lunch.""  They were truly that good.

It is set up more like an apartment and less like a hotel with lots of buildings scattered about, all surrounding a pool. (There is actually more than one pool to make this happen.) It definitely has more of a party vibe than some hotels, which is just fine by me. I can imagine during the summa, summa, summertime these pools are hopping. 

And, even though the feel of the place is fun, the staff of the place is nothing less than professional. Every single person I interacted with was beyond kind, helpful, and happy.

The Thai Peanut Sauce Pizza was a little weird, yet still tasty in its own way, and I could only handle one slice before growing tired of peanut sauce.  The Buffalo Chicken Wing Pizza was also pretty good. The highlight of the menu was the beer. The Elsie's Irish Cream, a milk stout, was one of the best stouts I've had (better than the Left Hand Stout). It had a strong coffee flavor but in a good way (I don't drink coffee). The Orange Blossom (mandarin orange hefeweizen) was the best Hefeweizen I've ever had, and I generally don't like Hefeweizens. The orange flavor definitely made that drink more than tolerable. I tried several other beers from Papago's own brewery, and the rest seemed  good. They have dozens of bottled beers in the fridges along the walls. But I never got a chance to try any of them. 

PRICE: Around $5 per beer on tap. Personal pizzas were $9 and large pizzas that could feed 2-3 people were $18. Appetizers were around $5. 

ATMOSPHERE: Pretty neat place. Funny statues, tvs, darts and all wooden furniture. Drawbacks are very small tables, uncomfortable chairs, odd layout, and almost too loud at times. 

SERVICE: The place seemed a little understaffed at times. We would be helped my a couple employees throughout the night as one would have to run behind the bar to make drinks or clean. All the servers were very nice and patient, but seemed to be a little overwhelmed and, thus, forgot to bring me a drink I ordered. 

SKINNY: Papago Brewing Company Inc has its pros and cons, but overall its a good place. I would definitely go there for the beer, while the pizza is good but nothing to rant about. Some may disagree with me, but I still prefer Tempe's own Four Peaks. I feel Four Peaks' food is better, better seating, and the beers are just as good as Papago's flavors. Don't let this comparison discourage you! Papago's is still a good place to drink and eat.",review,6GJM8bWV3m2cOYPjDjohJA,3,2,0,Female

The coating is perfect and light so you can really taste the vegetables but still get the crunch. The same is true with the mozzarella.

As far as entrees go, the portions are perfectly sized and flavorful. The pasta is perfectly cooked and coated with whatever you choose on the menu.

Strolled into this establishment at about 1:30 am, now to their credit I fully understand the crowd on mill at these hours so I lower my levels of expectations..

Place is moderately busy as we walk in, I get to the counter, order some pepperoni pizza and a pretzel with 2 drink cups. Second drink cup is forgot after they ran out of the dispenser, after I remind him he gets a fresh stock of cups to replenish his dispenser but first takes his hand, fingers placed inside the cup and hand me one. Yuck.. Gf didn't catch it so I gave her the first cup and took the lingering finger taste cup as my own.


Fast forward a few minutes, guy is in there , his friends are loud and his face is cut wide open from who knows what incident.. He is arguing and finally his friends get him out the door. Now if I ran this place that guy and his yelling and problems would have been asked to stay, his hands Nd bloody shirt bumping and squeezing past people was discussing . But.. Let's let that go because it's busy and again this is MIll and it is 2 am..



Fast forward 10 minutes.. Tell the guy the ice machine is out, several minutes later.. They fill it.. Again it's busy, no big deal on that one, and with the high temp in the place maybe it killed on the fingerprint bacteria in my cup while we waited.. ""I'm a wishful thinker""

Several more minutes go buy of people bustling past, smearing nastily cheese wish sandwich wrappers all o over the floor as We walked by ""place was trashed"" I go back up and ask the guy for our order.. He said"", oh sorry forgot"" I was amused but it's just sliced pizza and a pretzel.. He tosses them in the oven, and a couple minutes later I get them. Well pizza had obviously been there forever but it was pizza, pretzel was hard as a rock and couldn't eat it.


Then the show starts.. there had been a few people in there, that obviously knew the gentlemen working the register, the flooding actions are the cause for this reviewing of the above..

Short list

-employee is wiping his sweaty face by hand, receiving money..then is prepping pizza with topping BY BARE HAND.. Placing it in the oven, all with out gloves. This occurs over and over, then when his friends arrive there is a round of hand slaps... Um.. Where did these guys come from, did they wash their hands?, eww.  So in the 45 minutes I am in here,no hand washing, no gloves..his hands on food, toppings, money, hands, face, along with all over surfaces possible. Freaking DISGUSTING.

But it gets better.. His friends that he is conversing with are about to ice the cake..  One of them this red headed guy is reaching behind the counter near the pick up, and grabbing fries out of the Bin with his hands.. This happens no less than 10 times..

Another one ask his to meet them in the bathroom... Um what? Yes.. That locked bathroom father 1 am that is closed off to customers.. Hmm my imagination can only wonder what brief activity occurred in the restroom. could my dazed and non health conscious server and front man for this business also be doing drug's one can only speculate. His actions after reflected a very relaxed and dazed person.

Where I will give this guy a couple points, is end of the night he started picking up the place as it had slowed, well this obviously is his job and they have to clean up at the end of the night anyways..but was surprised at this point. 

At this point and my food not eaten we are done being entertained by watching all this and he asked to take our plate at which time he noticed I didn't eat much. He asked if the pretzel was not good and I choose this time to politely tell him the reasons above as why we didn't finish. 

He took it in stride, with no attitude but said simply they got busy and backed up. I do appreciate that but honestly there is ZERO excuse for even a small percentage of the actions to have taken place. I see this as a health risk and was more comfortable at taco stands in Mexico than this establishment. 



In short, I'll be contacting the owner of this location. 

I do realize this is a late night food offering, I do realize the clientele, but I also know this is unacceptable and some poor guy who is mismanaging this place needs a wake up call.


I will be back very soon, if anything just to see if changes are made after I voice my concerns. If needed ill be happy to forward my videos to the county health inspector.

With that being said, this cesspool of a building hasn't burned to the ground yet so I feel compelled to warn others before they consider spending an evening there.

Being new to the Tempe area, myself and a small group of friends decided to drop in to check it out.  As we approached the-dimly lit building I began to have second thoughts: my bloomy sense was tingling (more on this later). As we entered we were greeted by a lovely bouncer type gentlemen who begged us to pay the 5$ cover.... seriously. We were seated towards the back near a group of teenage mothers and their burly counterparts. We ordered food...

The food arrived in a timely manner, it may have been poisoned but i was too hungry to care. I ordered the mushroom/swiss burger.... 9 dollars-ish. If Mcdonalds ever begins selling their products in the frozen food aisle of grocery stores it might taste something like what they serve at The Vine. I had immediate food regret, my only consolation was the 1$ you call its and the poor old man behind the mic with his acoustic guitar wrapping up his set. Surreal. .. . .We regrettably paid and escaped out the back.

The pizza though, oi, so yummy.  We had just cheese and sausage, and it was delicious.  I was a little iffy ordering sausage as I'm pretty picky about it, but it was great.  Had I not been trying to be a little ladylike, I could see myself scarfing down most of a whole pizza.

But honestly, I think this place is slightly overrated. Don't get me wrong, I like this place, and I oblige them every time they want to go, but I think 4 stars is just right for the rating. 

We went there this weekend, and the typical scenario went down. Parking was cramped (lucked out to get a ""valet"" spot which I parked into myself as it was right out front by the entrance - no I'm not waiting for you Mr. Valet Dude to get into my car and pull it forward into the spot right in front of my face, thank you very much), and there was a short wait (maybe 10-15 minutes). We sat outside, which wasn't ideal since it was cold and drizzly, but we had patio heaters on both sides of our table so it was OK. 

Sadly we didn't make their $5 wine special, which ends at 5pm, so we were paying full price for the glasses of wine - ranging from $8 to about $12-13. I don't know about you, but I really am not a fan of paying $10 for a glass of wine when I can pay that for an entire bottle. But alas, I had 2 different wines through the course of the night, both on recommendation from the servers, and both decent. 

We ordered the infamous bruschetta, with the 4 choices being: smoked salmon (YUM!), warm artichoke (tasty), roasted red pepper (still good), and white bean with tomato (OK, but nothing to write home about). 

For dinner, I had the half & half combo (where you get to choose 2 different items), and I chose the mixed green salad (REALLY delicious, with an awesome combination of greens, pears, grapes, gorgonzola cheese, pecans, & poppyseed dressing) and half of a turkey/pesto pannini. The pannini was QUITE boring. Didn't have much flavor at all. I think it was lacking on the pesto. 

And honestly, this is what I come to expect at Postino. Some things are just unbelievable and you want to lick your plate clean, and other things are simply boring and tasteless (like the white bean/tomato bruschetta and the turkey/pesto pannini). 

And hence my rating of 4 stars rather than 5. If the parking was easier, the wines were always $5 a glass, and the food was consistent, I would give it 5 stars. Fair enough?  :)",review,weYT-xJwz8o7mLNWIhD6HA,4,4,3,Female

Here is why I can't give him a good review (and this is solely based on my personality and preferences while dealing with the service industry- others may think he's wonderful...)

1)  I purposely chose an early morning (7:30 a.m.) appointment so that I would get to work by 9.  My office is less than a mile from his office and I was still running into work at 9:05 a.m.  This is due to the very long-winded soap-box like speech that Dr. Greene gave me.  I am a get-in, get-out type of person who hates small talk and hates self-promotion even more and if I heard him tell me how often he visits the gym or works out one more time, I probably would have gauged my eyes out right there to never need an optometrist again.  I also learned all about his wife, friend's boat...you name it...he told me about it (completely unsolicited).

2)  I am an educated individual who does not need an hour-long explanation- filled with graphical references and cutesy anecdotes- about why I now need progressive lenses.

3)  The fear-inducing sales pitch by the staff and the doctor was a bit much.  I realize that all optometrists and dentists are going this route now- ""buy this test (not covered by insurance) and be free from worry that you'll instantly go blind""; however, if I want something, I'll ask for it...just like any other retailer.  

Like I said...I got what I needed, a solid eye exam and prescription.  However, I purposely did not buy glasses there due to the doctor's cheesy personality and the ""hard-sell"" environment.  Again, there are obviously (based on the other posters) people who are attracted to this type of personality...I am not one of them.  

Hence, why I do most of my shopping online.",review,SIG_tdhVIapMsHzYjIFyAg,0,0,1,Male

No, I'm not talking about the fact that Modern Steak is conveniently (albeit awkwardly) located in Scottsdale's Fashion Square. Instead, I think back fondly on a delightful little cocktail -- Belvedere, Grand Marnier, strawberry, basil and lemon juice, served chilled in a martini glass (as expected), but also with a little carafe of extr drinky-drink (unexpected), complete with a suspended ice-ball to keep your drink cold while you sip -- without watering it down. GENIUS. 

Ok, ok, so you're wondering: why the 3 stars? Well, genius cocktails only get you so far. I like to think that I've sampled a fair number of steaks in my day, from frou-frou to straight-from-farm fresh, and I gotta say that the whole steak experience at Modern Steak was about a 3 -- not bad, but not amazing. Just pretty...average. And for $46, I'm not %100 convinced it was worth it. Let me elaborate:

 - 12 oz. filet: I ordered it three of their five sauces -- the Steak Sauce (which cost extra...bummer) and the House-Made Ketchup. Now, one of the sauces that I simply a-dore with a nice steak is a Peppercorn sauce...so I was a little bummed when they didn't have one. So after getting a recommendation for the Steak Sauce, I went with it, and it was...well, kind of a let down. I didn't love either sauce, truth be told. Granted, I haven't tried the other three, so I guess I'll have to go back and check them out, but all in all, my steak experience was lessened by these sauces, rather than heightened. Boo.

 - Sides: we ordered the Roasted Brussel Sprouts and Yukon Gold Potato Puree. The sprouts were...meh, but I'm willing to admit that I've been spoiled by the best brussel sprouts of all time at a little place called Larchmont Grill in Los Feliz, CA. They are fantastic. But even so, I'm not convinced these were really that great...I felt they were a definite let down. As for the potatoes, they were literally SWIMMING in butter, which made them very difficult to eat...and to top it all off, both sides were pretty small, even for two people. 

All in all, I felt the level at which the meal was prepared was a bit sub-par considering the prices and what I can imagine they were going for...there are a lot of restaurants that do what they do, and do it a lot better, so if they want to compete, they're going to need to up their game. UP it. 

Combined with the fact that we were sitting awkwardly on the patio, which was really just sort of jutting out into the mall, I can't justify more than 3 stars. However, would I try it again? Absolutley. Get the steak? Maybe not. But I think that, for a relatively new restaurant, they're well on their way.",review,l4nJ5rCyw_qaFiO0-NLhtw,2,5,2,Female

The salad bar includes 2 types of base greens (Iceberg and mixed greens), with various toppings (Edamame, peas, mushrooms, croutons etc.) and dressings (Italian, low fat balsamic, ranch, thousand island, etc).  

Generally, with any main entree, you will have your choice of side and salad bar, or 2 sides.  They also have more healthy side options such as roasted spaghetti squash and steamed broccoli.  My husband had the chicken trio, and I had the creole fish on our visit.  The chicken was nicely presented, and was fairly tender and juicy.  Of the three different toppings (Balsamic and tomato, mushroom cheese, and mango salsa), my least favorite was the mango salsa since the mango in it, while fresh, wasn't totally ripe.  The creole fish was presented in a Spartan way, with just one piece of fish with a mound of side next to it on a plain white plate.  The fish (Some type of white fish, maybe carp?) was a freshwater white-flesh fish and had a decent seasoning and was cooked well. 

Service was friendly, but we did not have any silverware on our table when we were seated and had to ask for it after our entrees were served to us.  Drinks were refilled quickly as needed.

We arrived around 10:00 and was told that food would only be served until 11. That wouldn't be a problem at all except that our waitress didn't return with menus until close to 10:30 and then returned to take our orders at only a few minutes before 11. The place had other patrons, but it certainly wasn't so busy as to take an hour to get our orders. Unfortunately, on each of our visits, the waitress was half listening and seemed easily confused

The food itself was quite good. The Shepherd's pie was hot and tasty and the bloody marys were actually perfectly spiced. Neither was worth getting excited about, but they were certainly decent and reasonably priced. 

Considerably later in the evening, our waitress returned with the bill. There was one extra drink on the bill which no one ordered and she was perfectly friendly about saying she'd remove it, but we spent a good five minutes as she kept getting confused about our - apparently - very complicated instructions of ""$20 on the credit card. The rest in cash"" She continually read back excessively complex scenarios, and we kept asking her simply to put twenty on the card, that's all.

When she returned, she had taken $20 of our cash towards the bill, charged $60 to the card and kept the remaining $55 in cash as a tip. That's just shy of a 75% tip she assigned herself. 

We spoke to the manager, who couldn't find her for some time, and when she showed up, she blamed us repeatedly. She finally refunded the card and brought us our new bill, with the extra drink.

But, I am supposed to be honest.

This place has been the buzz since before I returned stateside. My coworkers had also been hearing the same buzz. We just had to go as the finale to our week of lunch. Yeah, I probably would've been better off at the Billet Bar across the street. I mean it is biker week. The people watching would've been stellar. The only people watching I had at RnR was the gorgeous server outside our window on the patio. But even his piece of art body won't bring me back.

The first hint should've really been the overpriced drinks we started with. I figured for that price they should be damn good so I ordered some lime concoction. A coworker got the stigmata. Holy strong... and not in a good way. I mean, I appreciate my drink as much as the next but not when I can't even enjoy it. 

One of my other coworkers on the other hand, was enjoying his blue moon. That was until he held it up to take another sip and the entire bottom of his glass fell off.. yes.. fell in one piece.. onto our table. What happened to the contents do you ask? That went all over him, the table, inside someone's wallet, and onto an iPhone and my face. The waiter wasn't even really apologetic about it aside from giving us some extra cloth napkins which weren't soaking anything up at all. No wet rag, no comp, no apology, nothing but another glass of blue moon we were hoping wasn't bought at a prank store and a sticky table, faces, and sunglasses.

The chicken lollipops were not what I expected, but really weren't bad. I did enjoy those. I also enjoyed the presentation of my fries. Cute silver bucket. Tons of fries. Couldn't finish.

I ended up getting a chicken sandwich that had brie and some other goodness on it. Totally forgot to order it without tomato, but I picked it off easily. 

I know what you're thinking, they serve breakfast here til 2pm, why the hell did the breakfast queen not order breakfast. Honestly, none of it wooed me enough that it looked delicious. They had a make your own omelet that was on my short list of things to order, but I'm glad I didn't after seeing a coworker's tiny ass omelet and bread with no other side for $10. Also, I highly doubt their Amish french toast is all that Amish. Just sayin'. I know a bit or two about Amish goodness.

So, back to my lunch.. it was just eh, which was sad. The description sounded so delicious I really was expecting to be wowed.. finally.. after all the mishaps I'd had up until this point. I do admit I loved the bread. It was delicious. I also appreciated that despite them not having honey mustard, aioli, or anything else to dip my fries in aside from ketchup and barbeque sauce (which was given with the sweet potato fries.. ew) they tried to make me honey mustard. Unfortunately it was just honey mixed in with bottle mustard ketchup. I ended up using the ranch dressing from the lollipops. 

What I paid for this was ridiculous.
The way they reacted to the beer mishap was ridiculous.
The food was meh.
Not even I was tempted to try breakfast there.
It was like the beautiful model that has no brains.... and I want some brain thought going into my dining experience. Don't try to woo me with simple sex appeal.

One of my coworkers commented that maybe in 6 months when the pans are seasoned well after being used the place will be worth it to try again. I told him maybe.

Had to edit that someone from our table got terribly ill too... oy vey!",review,7zDqr2I0-xpw9HF5Ha54cA,1,7,3,Female

Outside of the wait times, I've not had a bad experience @ Oreganos. The food was good, the people were friendly and I had a good time. This visit was no exception. Even when my wife got meat in her minestrone soup, the situation was handled impressively well. I've known for years that my wife is a VERY picky eater when dining out, she left all smiles and so did I.

It's one of few places I go to with ""stuff"" on the walls that I don't find obnoxious.  

Keep up the good work.",review,9JcWUImFT29_QrBO8mlcdA,0,0,0,Female

I don't know what I was expecting but I really liked the island concept of the place.  My friend recommended a salad and I got a Caribbean chicken salad with some sort of coconut rice, chicken,  oranges, pineapple, tortilla strips, etc.  Well, the salad was huge!!!  The honey lime dressing was very flavorful and complimented the salad well.  We shared the rumbi fries, which were a combination of sweet and regular fries, and as aforementioned in some other reviews, I love the sweet potato fries and wish they all could have been that (do I sound like the Beach Boys?).  

The decor was pretty cute and the music was great (Marley, Buffett type stuff).  The rice bowls looked fantastic, as did the sandwiches.  The prices were pretty good, considering the amount of food you received.",review,0Kz7-hBrrtBTdKBpEqb6AA,0,1,0,Male
