Nice that they have special pick up parking spots and entrance.  Made it an in and out operation.  Ordered the gluten free pizza with pepperoni and sausage.  My husband and son loved it and have already been asking to get it again.  I had the spaghetti calzone and was in HEAVEN.  I highly recommend it.",review,T7J9ae0wTskrI_Bgwp-4cA,0,2,0,Female
1901,SX0pCDRvuTEoXobTovJEIQ,2010-06-04,1D8buGjiJ6lZ5ZvvAjVOfA,4,"I am a fan of big and tasty sandwiches but have had very few really good ones as of late. That is until I tried this place. I was in the area and decided to give the them a try after spotting their sign. When I first walked in I noticed the place was empty (normally a bad sign) but it was a Thursday afternoon so no big. This was my first time eating here so I took a few minutes to see what they had to offer. The sandwiches here come in different sizes from a small 5 inch to a 2 foot extra long, which makes it easy to decide what to order depending how hungry you are.

The 8 inch sub is easily enough for one really hungry person or two not so hungry people. Seriously it is about the size of a subway foot long and taste way better to! You have three choices when it comes to bread. They are white, wheat, and sourdough. I chose sourdough for my sandwich and it was chewy and seemed to be really fresh. Like most sub shops they also have a selection of pre selected combos (18 to be exact) with toppings like Ham, Turkey, Pastrami, Salami, Capicolla, Roast Beef, and Tuna. The cheese selection includes Provolone, Swiss, Smokey Cheddar & American

What makes this place so different from most sandwich joints is the fact that they hand slice your meat when you order it. No more slimy meat that has been sitting in a case for hours and floating in weird juices Yuck! Finally a place that understands that it is OK to take the time to slice meat for each customer because it makes for a better tasting sandwich. One that a customer will want to come back for over and over again

For me this place set the bar so high most of the other chain places will never be able to compare with the quality of not only the food but the great customer service that I received from this place. It is not often that a place is able to make such a great impression on me (read my other reviews) but I will definitely make sure to give them my business the next time I am in the mood for a sandwich. The only thing that brought their score down was the fact that they had no customer parking and I had to pay to park in the garage. Yes I understand it is Tempe but why not at least offer to validate my parking LOL.",review,B8HTR0tC1NFe4yAuUV3tGw,1,3,0,Male
1902,CYMG5AsrhkhUPro2c6NSUA,2012-06-06,hVcICtxo4arSv8n1iPHWiw,4,"I dug this place. Got a great deal from Priceline, and I pretty much knew what to expect going in. I've stayed at places like this before across the country, and I can definitely say that this was a very pleasant experience. Everyone has complained about the beds being hard, but I didn't really find this to be the case. I like a firmer mattress, so I guess that's just my personal preference, but it wasn't like sleeping on a campus futon or anything. The towels were nice- nothing fancy, but definitely not the thin washed-out wisps of cloth that you might have expected at other places. The setup of the place was great- it's just like having a little studio apartment. Even had a coffeemaker, and an ironing board, which is strangely becoming a rarity these days.

I have to make special mention of one thing- the pillows, for some reason, were absolutely amazing. My girlfriend and I both agreed (and we're both flight attendants, so we KNOW hotels) that these were some of the best hotel pillows we've ever slept on. Couldn't exactly tell you why, but there was just something about them- proper amount of spring, cushioning, support, punchability, etc. 

If you need to be in Arizona on business, you couldn't pick a better place. The convenience is amazing- you're right near the highway and there's quite a bit of stuff within walking distance. We got some DELICIOUS takeout from some of the local restaurants, and it was SUPER Handy to have a microwave and kitchenette available within the room for our use!

So yeah, I gotta say, I didn't mind this place one tiny little bit. If you're used to Marriotts, Hyatts, and other fancy hotels, then you need to know that this isn't one of them. But for a relatively no-frills ""home away from home"" type of place, this is perfect!!",review,U5JyHRVayfHRHipogAq84A,0,0,0,Male

First of all, the service is second to none.  Every staff member that we encountered was very professional and happy to explain the food and answer any questions we had.  They obviously like working there because they were all so upbeat and smiley.  You feel welcome as soon as you step in the door.

Now for the food - fantastic!  I ordered the four course tasting menu and everything was superb.  My husband ordered the ribeye steak and enjoyed every mouthful, although the portion was a bit on the small side.  But, in between each course came a little treat of creativity from the chef so that's something we've never encountered before.  For example, we each had an espresso sized cup of a creamy soup that was so delicate and delicious that we were wishing for more.  They also served us a little savory doughnut, about the size of a dollar coin, that was oh-so-good as well as little cranberry ""shooters"" that had little teenie squares of jello (not really jello, of course, but a fruit gel of some sort).  Somewhere in between everything else we were also served a prosciutto mousse that was smooth and delicate.  As the meal drew to an end, they again brought out a little taster and this time it was piping hot mini cinnamon souffles with a creme anglaise on top.  For dessert, I ordered the goat's milk panna cotta that had a marmalade bottom and alongside were orange, grapefruit and strawberry segments and to top that off the server drizzled honey over all.  Fantastic!

We didn't consume any alcohol but we did have a nice bottle of water and purchased two coasters ($10/each) that flash colored lights when a glass is placed on them.  The total was $169, including the coasters but not including the tip so it wasn't an inexpensive night but it was well worth it.

My last trip I sat down to order a beer at the bar.  The bartender takes about five minutes to get me a beer, despite the bar being nearly empty, as he was too busy for me with his time and focus instead spent flirting with one of the servers.  

I drink my beer and want another.  The glass sits empty for about five minutes while he paces around the bar.  I try on three occasions to get his attention and ask for another.  The dude is just ignoring me at this point.  I guess they don't want my business and I just leave.  He can have the 8 cents he owes me in change for a tip... I just want out of here.  I feel bad when I leave that he even got the 8 cents from me.  I hope he spends it well.

On other trips here my wife and I have had the food.  It's not any better than the service sadly.  I have an English Bulldog at home with a poop eating problem and I'm not sure he would even find this food acceptable.  Overall just the worst restaurant around and it's no surprise why the place always looks so dead out front.  Nobody's there because it's simply horrible.  Avoid at all cost.  I wouldn't eat here again, but would give the bar another shot if I heard the replaced all the help.  Whoever owns this place needs to clean house.  Looking at other reviews on here, I see I'm not alone in my feelings about the service.  Get rid of these people already... just sad!!",review,GuRU8N7gKPNBnWCuUrLOGw,0,1,0,Female

IMO, it's overpriced and over-rated. The parking is usually impossible and often dangerously full of gargantuan SUVs and expensive sports cars. 

There is valet parking available at times that is also overpriced, pretentious, and unnecessary. The parking lot is tiny and I need a valet to park my car? What a racket. Overflow parking is available on street in the bicycle lane (thanks a lot folks!)

I used to have coffee here in the mornings week-ends in the outdoor cafe', but the place has become a neighborhood nusiance. The orange caters to a clientele that largely appears to regard itself as quite UMC. Probably they should be located in Paradise Valley instead of eastern Phoenix.

I give it three stars because the food is good. That can't be disputed. The facilities and the company leave much to be desired though.

We were underwhelmed by the food and hated the environment. Two of us built our own burgers, and one ordered a pre-made pick off the menu. We had the dill chips (fried pickles) as an appetizer. I can't say that any of us loved our meal, and as soon as we walked out we all agreed we weren't interested in going back. It was just no better than you could make at home (and I burn soup).  
The tables were crowded, too close together, and the place was uncomfortably noisy. Our servers were trying to clear plates as soon as one of us set down a fork (no one was waiting for our table), and asked for our dessert orders while we were still eating.

My friend order 1/2 dozen oysters (its an oyster house) and from his experience the person that shucked those oysters obviously was not a lover of them.  There were small broken pieces of the shell around the edges, and the bottoms were absolutely filthy dirty.  For being an oyster house you would think that would be the thing they take pride in, but not that night.  Then the remaining of our group ordered food and both those orders came out at separate times (almost 10 minutes apart) and one order was just a side of fries.

We were intially given a server that was not at all confident in her ability to perform her job even at the most basic of levels.  When she was asked about the ""specials"", she shrugged her shoulders and told us she didn't know about the ingredients or sides that were available.  I was still hanging in there and giving this place my all.  Afterall... she could have been new, having a terrible day OR goodness knows what she was going through that day?  Then the baby started screaming in the booth next to us and every server in the place ran for the hills, leaving the issue unaddressed.  PEOPLE!... if you have a crying baby, FOR THE LOVE... take the poor little thing outside and deal with the problem, don't force unsuspecting strangers to listen to it.  We opted for a changed of scenery within the restaurant after five minutes of non-stop crying and were moved into the main area of the restaurant and reassigned to a new server.

She no sooner finished warming my coffee (I use this term loosely, as it was more like colored water) before I glanced into the grill area which open for the whole restaurant to see.  This was the nightmare... I saw a rather large female cook with a tissue paper plug in her nose.  Anyone who's ever had a bloody nose knows that this is one of the few things you can do to passify the DRIPPING BLOOD!!

We have been frequenting this place ever since we moved to the area versus the rare trips we would take for the awesome cream cheese chocolate cake made by Caroline or the lunch Caesar chicken sandwich. Here are my ratings of each dining point I consider when going here:

Service: 5/5 Fast and very helpful, Even the chef will dig up custom stuff and cares what people think of the new entrees.

Ambiance: 4/5 The place used to be a home so it's a little cramped but nice nonetheless. Not as comfy as some others like Ticoz but we like it. As it is small
in seating ranges you can't get too loud so keep the rowdy folks to the Applebees locales.

Drinks: Ginger ale and the kiltlifter is nice as well as the blackwidow and black / blue martinis.

recommended Food:
Fish 5/5: My girl's favorites are the halibut,swordfish,miso salmon with basmati rice, she also loves the spinach and asparagus.
Sandwiches: 5/5 for roast chicken with green chili, side of coleslaw or balsamic salad 4/5 chicken caesar is good but sometimes is hit and miss
meatloaf: 5/5 best I have ever had, it is a beauty.
Tacos: 4/5 One time I had pork tacos they were the best ones I had tasted, the next time they were ok, then the last time they were great, not sure why but still recommended.
Cream cheese cake: 5/5 Made from local baker who used to do deserts for Circa 1900 but now does it for them and Urban Bean to name a few.
Steak,chicken, pork: 3/5 I have tried each and every one here and while you wont be disappointed there isn't a wow factor like the meatloaf. The sauces seem to not match or compliment the specific meat in my opinion. I would love a bordelaise sauce or onions and mushrooms with the filet for example.
Appetizers: ?/? I am not a fan of  the bruschetta but haven't tried the rest. I have heard the crab cakes are awesome but have yet to compare them to Fez's awesome versions.

I will give the place credit for the portions. It's not expensive and you get a lot of food.

Upon arriving, I had a deja vu moment of being there before...a long time ago, sipping a virgin strawberry daiquiri (I told you it was a long time ago), and thinking I was all that.  Yes, it was Bobby McGee's at one time!  So flash forward 25 years, and I'm having a strawberry lemonade ""adult"" beverage, which was quite tasty btw, in the company of 20 fabulous Yelpers!

We were given corn bread pretty quickly, and it was devoured pretty quickly.  A little on the crumbly side, but delicious nonetheless.  Because my husband could not join us, I went with the 2-meat combo (brisket and pulled pork) so there would be some left to take him.  Yeah, that's my story.  I was a happy eater to find I could order my meats sauce free!  The brisket was good, but a little too fatty.  The pork was really good, however; adequately seasoned and smokey.  I tried the spicy sauce on the table, and found it to be just right, just a little kick to it.  For sides, the mac and cheese was creamy and not lacking in sauce.  Yum.  The roasted corn was really really good.  If corn always tasted that good, I would move to Iowa.

Our service was great and they were accommodating for our request for separate checks with a 20% gratuity.  Our service was actually good enough, especially given a party that size, that I tipped extra.  And I did refrain from eating all of my meal, so that I could have a nice lunch the next day when my husband refused my offer of the leftovers.  Only problem was he didn't refuse.

If they are not in season, that's fine, but tell people when they order. Then, we had the cannelloni special with sausage sauce. Again, nothing special. Here's the kicker - they charge for bread (not special bread, just plain ol' bread) and for parmesan cheese to put on top of your pasta!!! In fairness, they do give you one piece of bread with your pasta, but if you want any more, you are paying $3. Let's be serious - the name of the restaurant is Pasta Bar and you charge for grated cheese?? That's like going to a sushi restaurant and paying for soy sauce or a burger place and paying for ketchup. The cheese actually on the menu as a side. Are you kidding me? We're not talking special grated cheese. It looked like the stuff from a green shaker bottle. I wanted to add some salt to our appetizer, but there was none on the table.

I sat at the bar which has surprisingly uncomfortable seating.  Really hard seats that cut me in the back of the knees.  The wine selection is nice.  Not big but two or three choices of each variety.
I ordered a glass of wine,  a small House salad and a pizza.  
The server behing the bar was ""professionally friendly""  
Then the wait began.  Fifteen minutes passed and I still had no salad.  I was able to get the servers attention and asked about my salad. She didn't check on the status of the salad but gave the excuse that several people had come in around the same time that I did.
Just about 3 minutes later both my salad and my pizza came out at the same time.  Very disappointing.  I wanted to eat my salad but I didn't want my pizza to go cold.  Note: This is extremely thin pizza...like a cracker crust...so it goes cold very quickly.
The server offered to send the pizza back to keep it hot but since it had fresh tomato on it, I didn't want the pizza to be ruined.
The house salad was fresh, good mushrooms and shaved pecorino cheese.  There were lots of red onions and the dressing, a house vinaigrette was very strong ""and vinegary"". For me the onion and vinegar were just overwhelming and I would not order that particular salad again.
The pizza had a good amount of toppings and held together pretty well, even considering how thin the crust is.

I was really excited to score a seat at the sushi bar, eagerly hoping to chat it up w/ the sushi chefs. However, they seemed too flustered w/ all the orders that they made a minimal attempt to talk to me besides asking, ""is everything ok?"" And I think the Mexican sushi chef is new so the Japanese sushi chef had to instruct him on certain things a few times. 

I started off w/ an order of kampachi sushi, per one of the recommendations of the Japanese sushi chef. While it tasted fresh, it was very blah to me... nothing special about it at all. 

A few minutes later, the waitress arrived to take my drink order. I decided to just stick w/ water and told her I was ready to order a few items off the paper menu. I had decided on mirugai (giant clam/geoduck) w/ mixed mushrooms, hamachi sashimi w/ jalapenos and ribeye sumibiyaki. First up was the hamachi sashimi w/ jalapeno slices. Nice thick slices of buttery hamachi, but all the seeds were scraped out of the jalapeno slices so they weren't packing much heat. After I ate them all, I remembered that there's a freakin recall on jalapenos in AZ and there wasn't a sign in the restaurant stating that their jalapenos are safe. JUST. EFFIN. GREAT. I hope I don't get salmonella. If you don't hear from me in a few days, pls call for help.. I live alone! And tell them, IT WAS THE JALAPENOS FROM YASU'S THAT DID ME IN!

Anyhow, next up was the mirugai w/ mixed mushrooms dish. Very small portion, but it was tasty. They were a bit skimpy on the mirugai to mushroom ratio so that was a little disappointing. About 10 minutes later, the waitress asks if I'm all done.. I ask her about the ribeye and she asked the sushi chef & kitchen in a frantic tone.. They reassured us it was almost ready. Another 10 mins later, it arrives.. I guess it was worth the wait.. it was soo tender I was able to ""cut"" off the fat w/ my chopsticks. DEEE-FREAKIN-LISH. It could have used a lil salt, but that's just me being picky. The 3 sweet dipping sauces helped. Next time, I wanna try the duck sumibiyaki. 

Since I had a $50 gift card (that I purchased from the radio promos for $25), I had another $10 to use up so I ordered the shrimp skewers wrapped in crispy noodles. The crispy noodles were like deep fried chow mein noodles. Interesting, but good.

Don't remember the specific themes the times we went to Scottsdale, but the ""Big Night Out"" meals go like this:  Cheese Fondue (you can choose the special or any from the regular menu) with assorted dippers, Salad Course (again, the special or off the menu), Main Course (if you get the ""Lobster Indulgence,"" it includes twin lobster tails, usually a couple kinds of beef (e.g., filet and sirloin), shrimp, chicken, salmon, and/or pork, often a stuffed pasta, and lost of vegetables) with assorted sauces, and the best part...

We came here for dinner.  Started out with some apps, and ordered the Monster Platter.  Complete with ""sliders"" on it that rivaled a Jumbo Jack for shear size, this could easily feed a family of four for a week.  Thank God there were 10 of us.  Most everyone ordered steak for dinner, and most were impressed.  I, on the other hand, was not that impressed.  All I could taste on my steak was butter, not meat.  I almost had to reach for the A1 Sauce, a cardinal sin in my mind with steak, just to make it edible.

Since we all had a round of golf in the morning, none of us opted for the giant 3-liter beer option they had.  But the booze selection, including wine, was quite impressive.  Service all around was very attentive.  And for those of you that love your barely-18 and barely-100lbs servers that Scottsdale is serving up on a daily basis, this is a great place for you.

The simple yet effective decor is vibrant without being tacky.  The service is very friendly and helpful.  They are always smiling and it actually seems sincere!
This is one of those places where you order your food from a cashier and they give you a number and you choose your seat from one of the 16 or so tables.  There is a nice little patio as well.  There are a couple of tasks you must do before they bring out your order. 
1. Fill your cup with your beverege of choice (Soft drinks and Tea only- no alcohol, hence only 4 stars).  Do get a beverege as the food can be very hot if you like that way-AND I DO!  And because I am a fool thinking it will never be hot enough, I grab a jar of the hot mustard and one of the Hot Chili paste to bring to my table.  You can, of course, choose chopsticks or a fork.  I usually start with the good intentions and select the chopsticks.  I pretend I know exactly what I am doing.  But these never work as I cannot get enough food into my mouth quick enough so I end up with at least 1 fork.
I am impressed how quickly they bring your order to your table.  I barely have time to do all of the above and get back to my table and they are bringing out a gorgeous plate of steaming Hot Korean with black bean sauce and tofu, or the yellow curry ""panang"" also with tofu.  You can aslo get chicken, beef or fish.  The meats are hand trimmed and do not have that grisle part that is such a turn off at other places.  The vegetable are as bright and fresh as the smiles on the employees' faces.
I must also confess my longing for PF Chang's or Pei wei has certainly  diminished after discovering Tott's.
Tott's even has excellent Won Ton soup. Now if they could only get a beer and wine license.",review,VA5zvXwaaj81_tjiQCH2mg,1,1,1,Female

Scottsdale Stadium :: AT&T Park is like _______ :: Oakland Coliseum.

a) Oakland A's
b) Rickey Henderson
c) Phoenix Municipal Stadium
d) Yankee Stadium

If you answered C, you, my friend are correct.  And you're pretty smart, too.  Give yourself a pat on the back.

Much like Oakland Coliseum, Phoenix Muni won't amaze you with state-of-the-art facilities, breathtaking views or spectacular nightlife nearby.  What you get here is a functional, simple, 40-year-old ballpark that serves its purpose.  The crowds here are much smaller than you would encounter at other parks, but it fits 6000-7000 people comfortably.  Unless you are in the premium infield seats, you will be sitting on the aluminum benches or on the grassy knoll.  Pick your poison, so to speak.

We always get the infield seats, because you can sit 12 rows behind home plate for under $20.  I don't care how bad the economy is, it's a steal!  Even if you sit directly behind home plate, you will most likely struggle to see the tiny outdated scoreboard screen in the centerfield.  

There are no fancy food choices at Phoenix Muni.  If you're not intimidated by enormous wieners, a footlong hot dog might be for you.  Believe me when I say, you will not be able to eat more than two, no matter how much you love hot dogs.  I am also a fan of the little dining area by the left field foul pole.  You can sit there at a table with a giant umbrella, hide from the sun and sip your beverage of choice.  If you're lucky, you can even watch the game from some of those seats.

The people who work here, from ushers to concession stand clerks, are incredibly nice.  They really do want to make sure you have a great time at the game, and it shows.

Parking here is very easy.  For $5, you can park in the lot right across the street.  The lot rarely gets full, and you can always almost find a spot.  I hear there are ways to find free parking if you are willing to walk a little more, but at $5, why would you?  It's important to know, though, that the walk from the lot ""across the street"" from the ballpark will take you about 7 minutes.  There is no crosswalk on the street, and you have to use that ridiculous pedestrian bridge they erected with the sole purpose of annoying most baseball fans.

So, +1 star for great seats, +1 star for cheap parking, -1 star for horrible scoreboard, -1 star for the pedestrian bridge.  A-OK, 3 stars.",review,ca_Q9OGfyjwOnfvXqmhdIg,2,2,2,Male

I have been looking for a restaurant like this since I left Chicago 5 years ago.  The style was perfect, the prices were not exorbitant, the food was delicious, the service was tremendous.

We had a table at 7, and even though we Happy Hour had passed, they still let us order off of the happy hour menu, so we had four courses for $30 a piece.  We started with Spinach Artichoke DIp, each had a salad (I had the Bacon/Bleu Cheese/Walnut - YUM), then I had the Balsamic Ribeye...  It was so delicious.  

One complaint, half of my steak was medium, a quarter was rare, and the other quarter was practically blue, but it still tasted great.  Oh - and the carrots were a little too sweet for me...  They tasted like sweet potatoes....

Anyway...  For dessert we had the bread pudding which was the best damned bread pudding I have ever had.  Add in the drinks (which were tasty) and our bill was still nothing too crazy.

Our server was just the right combination of hands off and hands on, and i dug her big time.  We ended up having a long leisurely meal, were there from 7-9, but it didn't feel like we were there a long time.  It was just a nice relaxing meal...

Cons:  more expensive than In 'N Out. 

Neutral: Thick burgers are more like your home grilled burgers, all well done and crispy on the edges - not like In ""N Out's thinner patties.

I've come here a lot with friends late night, and the food was always scrumptious and service excellent, but after last night I MUST PROTEST.

I ordered the Bourbon BBQ Wings, a promising title appealing to my tastes exactly. They arrive with a generous bowl of ranch and a few stalks of celery. I know most people don't eat the celery, maybe that's why, so I guess carrots were out of the question.

THE WINGS WERE FROM BABY CHICKENS!!!
I was shocked. some of them (both sections) were not 1.5 inches long, I swear. The sauce was yummy BUT I'M ANGRY ABOUT THE WING SIZE!!!! 

Come on 5& Diner, you're better than Long Wong's, ACT LIKE IT and serve up goodness on all fronts!
(See my scathing review on them as well.) I want so much to write a glowing review here but NO.

So my friend got the Southwestern eggrolls. They were sliced open diagonally and nicely presented on the plate. I tried one, and eventually my friend let me have the last 2. They were hard and irritating to eat, and tasted fine for tourists as it reminded me of Rubio's or Arriba's standard. I think Jack In The Box could've put out a better product overall.

Another friend got the chicken quesedilla.
Although I didn't taste it, presentation looked nice with the pico and guac on the side. The quesedillas were a good size and thickness. My friend took half of it home.

I can recommend the burgers, onion rings, and breakfasts.

Prices went up a couple of years ago to an average $9.49 for a burger plate, and slightly less for appetizers and other things. Service is always good, but don't go if you're in a hurry and the place is packed.

I really enjoyed the little bit of complimentary bean dip that I was able to snatch between the giant scoops that my oldest son kept shoveling into his mouth. The salsa had a tasty kick to it, and the chips were extra large, thin, and crispy.

The eldest ordered the poco chimis off of the appetizer menu. Much as he liked them, he was full with 2 chimis left. My husband (who received the leftovers) found the filling a bit dry, and the jalapeno cream cheese too bland to deserve the 'jalapeno' in its name.

This is a huge plus and isnt found anywhere else in town that I have seen.   There is a prefered customer program and most livestock is local grown and special items are taken in a wish list and you can get called once available.    After my month long search for the perfect store to set up my custom order that could also fulfill my stocking needs I couldnt get my order in fast enough for a complete custom setup installed and delivered.   Pricing was fantastic and cheaper than anywhere in town and the ability to come in anytime and get advice no matter what the need is makes this shop feel like home when you walk in.   If your looking for a one stop shop that is friendly, knowledgeable, and isnt out to empty your wallet in a bad way this is your place.   Thanks again Reef Monsters for the help in sorting out what was an overwhelming amount of information into a custom tailoring to what I could handle and needed to continue in this hobby.",review,4Zk_SPnvJ8Ybdjwo4BOJ5A,0,0,1,Female

We ate here for dinner both nights we were in town. The majority of the meals ordered were the 3 taco plates. One carne asada, marinated pork, and carnitas, served with yummy rice and beans- the tortillas were very good too. This is definitely the plate to get here. I think that the carne asada ones were the best. 
Normally we order all of our food medium spiced, but beware of the red hot sauce that they put on the tacos. My daughter somehow got an extra dose on her tacos and was having a hard time getting through the burn. This somehow justified the obscene amount of Fresca's ordered. :) If you are remotely sensitive to heat, order your sauce on the side.",review,Obtx8kRJAwV8AlmNH3x0Rw,0,2,0,Female

1990,0K634ehk41ZRc4kj3NTAEQ,2011-07-10,dcW4NqwQR-YyfLHIf2H3EA,5,"I absolutely love Chompies! It's the closest thing to a New York style deli that I have found in Phoenix. They have a very large and extensive menu and everything I've ordered has been really good.

They also have an amazing bakery that offers a very large assortment of tasty treats such as black and white cookies, red velvet cake, enormous éclairs, napoleons, and New York style cheese cake.

I'd say that my favorite thing on the menu is the pastrami sandwich, although I recently tried the Jewish Sliders after seeing them on Man vs. Food. The sliders were really good, unlike any slider I have ever had. The challah bread and potato pancake gave these sliders a very unique flavor, very tasty. I also tried the Western Sliders and those are good as well. 

Although I live closer to their new location in Chandler, I still go to the Tempe location because of the hot ASU waitresses.

Chompies is the best!",review,o3FDn0YCRJpGHMPrpuUUpg,0,2,0,Female

Previously Shanghai Palace, this out of the way restaurant serves up some of the best curry and pad Thai, that I have ever tasted in my life! The Panang Curry is so savory and aromatic, literally one of the best things I have ever had. I honestly crave this dish about twice a week.
Also any thing on the menu can be made vegetarian this is a huge bonus for all veggie's around town!
 The Chef-owner Tottie Kaya, is always very hospitable. She walks around to each table making sure everything is up to standard. I have never once had a bad experience at this delicious eatery. So if you love Asian cuisine, you must dine at Tottie's!",review,9tVLD8PjH7Wwn_EAmCHzWA,3,3,0,Male

But I always find myself there either before or after my dance trips. I totally dig the atmosphere at Mulligan's - it's chill, unpretentious, and never obnoxiously crowded. The prices are decent and the location is pretty centralized.  The DJ isn't always the best, but when you're with good friends and good drinks, Mulligan's makes you feel at home. 

Mulligan's kind of has that dive bar feel but doesn't make you feel like you might get mugged and stabbed in the eye.",review,-eIsz3-MIQT6ueiM4MusHg,0,0,2,Female

As I was making my way through, I encountered a new facade with Southwestern designs that I have never seen before.  ""Cool!"" as I exclaimed to myself. 

It looked intriguing enough that I went in to ask the hostess for a menu.  After gazing around for a few minutes, the Chimichanga Entrée caught my attention! Content I was! j'adore Chimis!

After being seated in the, rather blandish, outdoor patio area with mistifiers cooling away, I put in my order: a Chimi and an Arnold Palmer.

Not too long, my waitress brought out some cool, fresh salsa and chips.  Nothing too dazzling, quite ordinary.  Chips were crispy, oily, and a tad salty.  Arnold palmer seemed to lack both the sweetness and citrus.

Now come the Chimi with a side of rice and beans.  Typical Mexican, you would think right? Well, up until I took my first bite into the rice! Puzzled face I was--like an Anime character.  I steadily kept taking small bites after small bites, analyzing what in the heck I was eating.  Generally, it was just sweet and overpowering what I would think a Mexican rice should be.  The corn bits probably only enhanced the sweetness further! The waitress confirmed honey was used but I initially guessed coconut!

The beans with pieces of bacon was just simple and watery.  At first, it seemed to have that smoky, cowboy-ish hint to it, but fell short of a decent side.

The Chimi was quite underwhelming in its overall taste.  What blanketed this deep-fried burrito were green chili (tasteless for the most part), drizzle of this sweet white cream (unsure of what), and some white cheese (unsure).  The tortilla shell was crisped enough and the chicken shred lacked the savoriness that I would have expected from a true Mexican joint.

Nothing made sense to me! Where was the Mexican? I tried very hard to find the positive in my meal.  I quit half way to be honest.  I hate to mention this, but I did garbled some of what I chewed back out to my plate.  Overall, it missed the savoriness that would have saved the meal.  I desperately wanted Tabasco sauce like it was the end of the world, but unfortunately it was too late.

I explained my calm, analytical dining experience to my waitress and she was very understanding and was fine with removing the item from the bill.  5-stars for that.

I really am unsure of returning as first impression is a pretty big deal to me.  The happy hour menu did not look that appealing either.

I guess the question is, how much can you expect out of Mexican-esque establishment that sits on a Fashion Park?  Heed, heed, heed this review.",review,hjJPKQ1Ah91h3fVbc8GsOg,1,4,1,Male
