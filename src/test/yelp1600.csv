The service is nice and polite even though a couple of the servers don't speak much English. The building is a trip -  the outside looks like a doublewide trailer on a foundation, but the inside has a homey Northeastern Mexico look. On the other hand, even though the guacamole was fresh, it's a little bright and lacks strong taste, and the red hot sauce is too watery(it's still got that kick). Overall, if you're not itchin over substandard guacamole and marginally inflated prices for the location then it's a great place to chow.

This place is cool, I did get a mild mobster vibe, but that's alright with me.  And I think the food is fantastico.

If you're uncertain which wine would go best with your meal, don't hesitate to ask because the servers are pretty friendly and knowledgeable. 

Try the crab and shrimp cakes for an appetizer and the tortellini portifino for dinner- both are delish.

First of all, I was organizing a Happy Hour and Dinner for a retirement party that we had on Friday, August 3rd, 2012.  Reading the fine print on the website it did say that happy hour prices were in the bar area, although because it was a party of 30 we could not fit in that area.  One of the attendees called the restaurant and spoke with the Manager which he confirmed that we were going to have happy hour prices. It turns out when we got to the restaurant they thought we were another party for 40 people that booked the spot for happy hour, but the attendee that spoke with the Manager was misinformed and they only gave us one round of happy hour prices.

Second of all, our server was awful.  There were a couple of servers that actually waited on us because there was a table of 10 people.  Anyways, she took wrong orders and did not listen to our needs and was rushed, rushed, rushed.  Then a new person came in late on our table, and she was not even served when she saw her.  We had to track her down. I am sorry but the amount of restaurants that I have been to, this was the worst service ever.  I mean I had servers that actually new who was new at the table and took their order once they arrived.

I ordered full size of fried green tomatoes, 1/2 order of fried okra, and a plate of sweet potato fries.  The server gave me my fried green tomatoes, but gave me full size of fried okra and the sweet potato fries was horrible.  So I had the server take my sweet potato fries because it was awful.  The server took it away without even asking me if I wanted another batch. I don't cook much, but I probably can fry those tomatoes alot better than the restaurant. I told the server I ordered 1/2 size of fried okra, and she said ok and brought it back to the kitchen then she brought the same dish back and said that she will just charge me for the 1/2 size order.  

And lastly, when the server gave us the bill, it was all separate checks and did not even do that right.  The server was putting stuff on the bill that did not even belong on the check.

So needless to say...I AM NOT COMING BACK TO THIS RESTAURANT AGAIN.",review,-ZVmHZcdn_OH52QWwSMimA,0,1,0,Female

I purchased a Groupon to the restaurant a month or so ago, and am glad that I did because otherwise may not have noticed this cute place amongst it's neighbors in the strip mall.

We started with the brochette, and spent the next 10 minutes raving about how amazing it was.  The tomatoes were crisp and fresh, the chopped garlic was very complimentary, and the oil had a fantastic flavor.  Definitely a good choice.  For dinner I had the spaghetti and meatballs and my boy had the chicken toscana.  Both had a very authentic Italian flavor that accompanies food made with care.  The meatballs were everything I was craving...a little spicy and filled with flavor.  My portion left enough for leftovers, but Brent ate his entire meal.  We both left with a full belly and intentions to return again soon.

I have no complaints about the food (delicious!), but docked the restaurant a star for two reasons:

1. The lights are way too bright.  While I appreciate that the restaurant is more casual than some Italian joints I've been to, a dimmer switch on the overhead lights could do wonders for the atmosphere!

2.  One of my favorite treats at Italian restaurants is bread dipped in tasty olive oil with fresh ground pepper and Parmesan cheese.  The bread is delicious, but the prepackaged butter that accompanied it didn't impress me.  I also would have liked freshly ground Parmesan on my spaghetti.

We noticed a lot of pizzas being picked up for takeout, and both thought the bar looked like a cute little place to come have a drink and a bite sometime.

1513,PoRYjYUSjmeWM1WLsx_45w,2007-10-23,6b5sifuzXWw0cMd_8c9how,3,"Uh-oh. Where am I? 

The view from atop the mountain is superb. The city can be seen in all directions. Look, there's Downtown 1 and Downtown 2. And a bunch of houses under construction. And look at that sky. Wowza. 

Ok, so stopping to enjoy the view is one thing. Stopping to figure out where the hell you are is another. ""Don't worry,"" I told my friend. ""This city is laid out in a grid. If anything, we can walk down the other side of the mountain and cut back across on the street."" Oh, little did I know. 

Let me give you the back story. I've been to South Mountain twice. The first time was Christmas Eve 2006 when hardly a soul could be found. I met a friend there and we blazed our own trail. He always had his jeep in sight, so no harm in getting turned around. I trusted him to be my guide. 

The second and last time I hiked South Mountain was in February. My best friend flew in to Phoenix for the weekend (for my birthday) and since the weather was so great (in comparison to Detroit), she wanted to be out in the sun as much as possible. No problem. I knew where we could go for a good hike. Little did I know we'd get lost. 

We parked at the 24th St. entrance and picked our path, the Mormon Trail. We were on our way to discovering religion, we joked, passing by several other hikers. When we reached a recognizable summit, we stopped to appreciate the view... and then ponder our location. Should we turn around and go back the way we came? Were we still on the Mormon Trail? Where were the markers, the loops, the signs from God? We looked at each other, each of us having a take-no-prisoners personality when it comes to conquering great piles of rock. ""Onward!"" we shouted, punching the air with our fists. 

A little while later, we were once again stopped, our eye squinting against the retiring sun. I wouldn't call us ""lost,"" as this point in time, but that's only because I'm too stubborn to admit such an error. ""Let's ask somebody,"" I suggested. So, the next hiker dude that passed by, we stopped to ask him, ""Will this trail loop back around?"" ""Where do you want to go?"" he asked. That's when I realized we had tied our tennis shoes tight only to march into a rocky labyrinth. I told him where we parked and he said it was a good 2 hour hike back to our car, yet about another mile or two to the 48th St. entrance. Oh, no problem, I thought, since the city was laid out like a grid. Little did I know there are exceptions to that. 

We pressed on, thanking our impromptu guide friend. We hiked and hiked and hiked, passing by fellow hikers and mountain bikers. Finally, the trail opened up to flat land. We were close, or so we thought. When we reached the end of the trail, there was no parking lot and no street connecting us to where we needed to go. Instead, there was a long gravel road that weaved itself through a golf course. W.T.F.

We set out to walk the long gravel road until we hit Baseline, in which we were determined to cut back Westward and find my car, the only way we had of getting anywhere. The sun was setting. We had no time to waste. 

Having hiked about 15 miles already, our feet were heavy, like cinder blocks. But, we continued on. ""Let's hitch a ride,"" I suggested. People were gathering in their wonderful Ford pick-up trucks and jeeps. Hikers are friendly, I thought; somebody was bound to accept our plea for help. We opted to just do this ourselves. 

That's when a car slowed down. ""Ugh, creep,"" I thought. Instead, it was our helpful hiker friend from the summit. He asked if we needed a ride. My best friend and I exchanged glances. I thought, ""We can take him."" After a 70-second long pause, we accepted. She hopped in back and I rode shot gun, leaving my seat-belt off and the door unlocked, in case of a speedy getaway. 

We chit chatted on the drive down the road, which lead to another road, and then another and another, until we finally touched Baseline. Where the hell were we? That's when it hit us. We would have been walking another 7 miles on foot back to my car. All these windy, disjointed roads. Damn golf course. Damn South Mountain. Damn unmarked trails. It should change its name to the Moron Trail, for we just blazed it enthusiastically. 

The kind hiker man dropped us off at my car and drove away. With a sigh large enough to blanket the skyline, we unlocked my car, got inside and drove away - away from South Mountain, nature's beast and practical joker. 

We counted the miles and the minutes it would have taken us to get back to my car. Another hour, at least. The sun would have set by then and we would have missed our dinner engagement. Lucky for us, we stopped the right hiker friend at the right moment; otherwise, I may never have made it home to write this review.",review,APLIPfq1Rf8QyhHHk2uAyA,4,5,4,Male

The espresso was perfect and did not require any sweetener. I also got a blueberry muffin which wasn't very good, perhaps it was low fat or something but I am very picky about pastries anyway. 

My biggest problem with this place is the fact that they do not have a bathroom. Coffee makes me have to pee and when I discovered this and had to walk all the way to the baby gap because the place next door with a bathroom wasn't open yet requiring me to pack up my computer and leave my drink and food unattended, it was a bit undesirable. I know it's a mall type area but it still surprised me for a drink/food place. It does not set the tone for a place to spend a lot of time which may be their intention. Also, I love John Mayer but they played his same songs over and over again. Perhaps mixing it up or putting on a pandora station would be better?

Our server was quite attentive without being intrusive. Our wine glasses were never dry, and she instinctively sensed that it would be a three bottle sort of night and suggested additional bottles to go with our meal.

The food was of a generous proportion, so bear this in mind when ordering. My Fez Salad was fresh, crisp, and the combination of the dressing and goat cheese hit the spot. Our hummus platter was heaven-sent, and had just the right amount of garlic. The lamb kisra was also exceptional, and immediately devoured. The aforementioned Harissa fries were fiery and I often dream of them. No, really. If Fez was located in Tucson, I would gain at least ten pounds from just eating harissa fries every day.

Very nice that it is located by the Asian market and shops. They have a frequent buyer card you can pick up in the front (for every $100 you spend, you get $10 off your next bakery purchase).

One one of the weekday evenings they have this special thing where you can request your musical choice from this rather large list. Its real neat. What else is neat - their happy hour on Wednesday (I am not sure what day exactly to be honest. Call them if you really want to know.), when drinks, starters and most rolls are 1/2!

The dual menus, one french-ish and one southwestern-ish are sort of on odd pair, but it is Scottsdale. The appetizer, shrimp ""beinets"" were simply breaded, fried and very greasy while the lavender dipping sauce and salad that came along with were much more appealing. Both our entrees were wonderful and perfectly cooked - so well in fact, the sides were essentially meaningless, even though I remember them as fairly good also. So if you find yourself here, keep the Ahi Tuna and the Wild Boar in mind.  The wine menu is extensive and filled with surprises. 

The wait staff were classic in service, yet easily engaged in conversation and very friendly. They only acted snobby for the people who expected it, we on the other hand provided the Diamondbacks/Rockies scores and had a great time! We ended the night with great Grand Marnier birthday souffles.

Let me first start with the location.  It's very stupid.  Very easy to miss and it blends in with everything else.  No personality.  I guess when you are so famous though, you don't need ""personality"" to get people in.  Second of all, I hate Scottsdale.  Again, I can't subtract stars for this, it doesn't make sense.

As for the cupcakes, they are really only okay.  I will set aside my disdain for chains and judge solely on the quality of the cupcakes.  I ordered a red velvet and a peanut butter chocolate.  The red velvet was very plain.  It lacked the subtle cocoa flavor and the lovely tangy flavor of the buttermilk that should be peeking through the copious amounts of red food coloring.  It wasn't.  I just tasted red and cake.  Not really that great.  To top it all off, my cupcake crown popped off the second I picked it up.  This pissed me off.  It essentially ruined my first bite.  At least I could still eat it.  The cream cheese frosting was so-so.  I really like a big bold cream cheese flavor to pair with a red velvet, and this was barely tangy.  It was super sweet, slightly grainy and it got that crust on the top from sitting out too long.  The red velvet overall was kind of meh.

The peanut butter chocolate was definitely not what I had hoped for.  The cake was very dense and peanut buttery, but lacking in sugar.  It was studded throughout with chocolate chips.  The frosting was chocolate, and it's texture was nice and smooth.  It was covered in chocolate jimmies, I just love those.  This cupcake was okay.  The lack of sweetness in the cake made me wished it was saltier.  A saltier cake paired with the delightfully sweet frosting would have made for a much more grown-up and sophisticated cupcake.  It was just okay as is.

Sprinkles, I will not be back.  I don't like you.  Good luck in all you do though.  I would never wish bad things on a cupcake bakery.",review,W_QXYA7A0IhMrvbckz7eVg,1,2,2,Male

The food here is fucking brilliant... especially for a chain. Amazing burgers. Their Diablo Chicken pasta dish is to die for. The cornbread is actually good - I fucking hate cornbread and yet I'll scarf this shit down like it's crack. Their chips and salsas aren't that great - they'll do the job, but I'm still not convinced about them. I'm also unimpressed with the sides that come with the mains, but I don't come to this place to eat the sides. 

As I've said before, their margaritas are awesome. They'll fuck you up though, so make sure you have a ride home or else go see a movie to sober up. 

The atmosphere is low-end upscale and pretty nice and cozy - kinda dark inside and a bit generic, but generic is better than flashy, ugly and distracting. Service is upscale as well and I'm usually pretty pleased with it. They offer free valet parking for customers too which is perfect now that they charge an arm and a leg for the parking structure.

Here's my old review for reference: 

Great margaritas to be had here... really strong and tasty. This location isn't very busy ever it seems... perhaps with Fat Tuesdays around the corner, it's just too much competition.

It's a good place to grab a strong margarita before heading over to the movies or something. Their food doesn't inspire me to eat there, so all I've had are appetizers so far... mainly chips and salsa.  Salsa sucks.

It's also got some competition from Macayos down the street which doesn't help. I don't know if this place can stay in business much longer unless it gets busier. It could just be the times I was there though.",review,Cp-PV8rsypbO-xBrQ6KmQg,4,3,0,Female

Second, I decided to give them a try for an early Friday dinner, about 5 in the evening. There were a few people dining in the restaurant, and quite a few people on staff for the evening. The dining room is pretty well decorated, more so than I thought it would be, giving a faux Hawaiian feel to it. Seeing some people there at that time gave me hope for a good meal.

I asked the lady manning the counter what was good, and she took a bit of time to walk me through the menu. Emphasizing the plate lunches, I decided to try the Combo that would get me the most variety. I elected for terriyaki beef and kalua pork. I took the side of the 'potato mac' and got my meal to go.

Arriving home, my meal sat for about 5 minutes before I had it unboxed and ready to enjoy. Considering that fact, everything was in pretty good condition. The potato mac was a bit more room temperature than cold, but that was my own doing. The rice stayed warm, the pork moist and really flavorful, and the beef sweet and tender.

Having dined at a few places offering plate lunches in the past, the potato mac was probably what sold me as much as the meats on why I'll return. Potato mac's tend to have a pretty flat flavor, and when I find out how Hawaiian's garnish them, I will be excited to get some more flavor in them. But it was just the right amount of dry ... I've had many potato mac's that are just too wet, but this felt about perfect.

-Their deli rocks my socks. Always fresh and always tasty, I've purchased more than a few dinners and have never been disappointed.

-The ready to cook stuff is delicious too. In the mood for some kind of meat stuffed with a vegetable and/or cheese? This is the place.

With a 4 star rating, I was expecting 4 star quality food. Well, some of it was good, but some of it could be better. First of all the atmosphere was pretty nice. It almost felt like Cheers, where everyone knew your name. Even though we didn't know anyone there, everyone talked to one another. The T.V. in the corner drew most everyone's attention. You could tell who the regulars were. They were up front and closest to the T.V. 

Most of the food was fresh. The Shrimp was very fresh and tasty. The rice was also seasoned probably and tasted almost as good as back East Chinese food, it just wasn't brown. Orange chicken was good, but a little hard. Not as moist and juicing like I wanted. The chicken was dry. It was flavors well, but was dry inside. Seems like it was under the heating lamp too long. The sweet & sour soup was good, but I've tasted much better. The egg drop soup wasn't too good though. Spare ribs weren't bad. Also a little dry, but not as bad as the chicken. The Egg-foo-yung was not good. Hockey puck shaped or not, it was too watery and didn't taste like real Egg-foo-yung. Everything else was pretty average. For the price, it wasn't bad. I would go back and eat there just so I could have the rice and shrimp. So pretty much 2 stars for the food and 1 for the atmosphere, service and cleanliness. Place was very clean and service was decent. Not a 4 star restaurant. Barely a 3 star. I think my wife gave it 2 stars. If you go there and find certain foods you like, it's probably worth the $5-$6 to go back and eat as much as you want of those particular foods. Skip the bad stuff and eat all of the good tasting foods. Other buffets will run you $10-$15, so this place could be a gem if the food gets better.",review,Ts6UNH4LQp4YIwATf-cqnw,1,1,0,Male

Their pizza and bruschetta bites were great.  And after we quickly inhaled the samples, we decided to get more food.  

The menu is pretty huge and everything sounded and looked delicious.  Yes, we were eyeing everybody else's plate as well; the bar seats are good for that!  After ooh-ing and ah-ing over what we saw, we decided to split the spinach and artichoke dip that came with chips and pit bread.  It was great!

The best part about Maizie's is that they just seem to do things right.  Friendly, casual service so you feel like you're among friends.  All sorts of specials listed up on the boards so 1) you don't have to feel dumb asking and 2) you don't have to feel even dumber when you forget and have to ask again.

I have no idea why. Is it because it's in Arcadia? Is it the added expense of upkeep involved in over-stocking the wine section, or the fancy olive bar, or the gourmand cheese selection? Or maybe it's the added cost of employing cashiers by not installing self-check out lanes. Do I really have to stand in line for ten minutes behind a suburbanite with 2.5 screaming childes just to buy a couple sticks of buttah?

Everything looked clean and open, which i didn't expect from the outside appearance. 
The service was kinda slow. I have worked in the restaurant/bar industry for 10+ years and I understand how things can go wrong that the customers don't see so i am not going to be hard on these guys. (By the way, the girls are all dressed pretty skimpy and the guys are just short of guidos, so if you have small kids this may not be the place to bring em) So the drink service was slow and throughout we never were really sure who our server was. One girl took our drink order, another brought them, someone else took our food order, someone else brought our food, and someone else came over to see if all was ok... There had to be 15 employees and maybe 25 customers, not to mention the kitchen staff. 
So the service was slow and not sure why because we were constantly seeing the staff goofing around with one another and as mentioned before it was not busy. BUT the associates were very nice the entire time so it was not bad service my any means, just slow and a little unattentive. 
It seemed to turn into a club style late at night, which could explain the extensive staff. 
There is a wheel that you can spin with different actions on it, such as, ""kiss a random' '50% off bill"" ""go plastic"" (which apparently gives you a chance to win plastic surgery). I would suggest NOT attempting this if you are not single.
