I have, on many occasions, gone out of my way to stop in QT over other gas stations, because not only are they much much nicer, but they are very clean and offer a ton of gas station fare (drinks, shakes, coffees, juices, snacks, etc).  I really appreciate how quickly they work, with cashier's that are able to take care of two customers at once.  I usually abhor using gas station bathrooms because, let's face it, we've all been there and seen how putrid they can be, but whenever I visit QT they are always clean! They mop, sweep, clean the bathrooms, windex the doors...and for that I applaud you all, thanks for the cleanliness:D",review,oXBahXJCXUEATm5IVexw8A,0,0,0,Female

After asking the driver if he dropped off at 'Pecos', not 1 but, 2 times, and he agreed both times, we wound up in Chanlder/Gilbert border NOT on Pecos. My mistake in thinking there was only 1 Pecos stop.  Newbie me had no idea. It was easier when our parents pinned our bus stop destination on our shirt when we were 6!

Stranded, about 8 miles away from my park n'ride, I was advised to call their help number. So, I called Customer Service who transfered me to Wanda, the dispatcher. I've never talked with someone so nice, helpful and compassionate - THIS is how customer service is supposed to be...HP, Dell, are you listening?! 

She not only tried to find me other buses to link and other routes to my stop, but in the end, tracked down a site supervisor Bob, down the road, luckily he was on a run, and took me to where I needed to go. He was so nice and understanding, I didn't feel like a total doornob. 

Tell you what, I can't think of anywhere else where their customer service was actually helpful, and hope these guys at least get a bonus, stipend or something. They went out of their way when they didn't have to. Thank you and great job - wish more people modeled your service-oriented organization!",review,Lzug6WSdwzdGECzcgHPEyw,3,0,0,Female

Maybe I am just a fuddy duddy, but it seems that the clientele are cougar-like women, aged 30-50, with bleached hair and sequin tops. I expected a quiet wine bar, but instead it is more like a loud night club.

The hubby and I visited The Living Room on a Saturday night, so maybe the whole ""we-wish-we-were-a-club"" thing was just a once a week occurrence, and maybe, just maybe, I am totally un-cool, but we don't plan to return.

Food: Wine specials were fairly decent and priced well. Food was average (3 stars). We had a variety of bruschetta, a tuna salad and a strawberry salad - way too much dressing on both salads. 

Service: It took a long time to get a table (~30 mins), but it was Saturday night and crowded, so expected. Once seated, our waitress seemed more concerned with anything other than serving us. She was not very attentive at all. She asked for my order and walked away. My husband was like ""uh, I kind of want to order too""

Atmosphere: The overall look and feel of the place is pretty neat. It is a smaller restaurant with lots of patio/outdoor seating. Decor is large heavy curtains and many couches, thus the name The Living Room. However, as I mentioned earlier, the music was ridiculously loud. They had a DJ playing music so loud, having a conversation was impossible (and we ended up sitting pretty far from the speakers!). We left a soon as we finished our dinners (didn't stay for more wine or dessert) because the music was just too annoying.",review,98jhrpmyYcLLM0-9z-r2oA,0,2,3,Male

It's too bad it's not located on the ground floor of the school, replacing the space currently occupied by Subway. It would be much healthier for the students.

I had their breakfast protein shake, which was AWESOME! Even though it was $6, I ended up having TWO!

While the shop is not as big as a Whole Foods, it does provide the organic and healthy staples, while serving fresh salads, pastries, and different types of chocolates. I didn't get to purchase the local bran of organic ice cream, which seems to be popular. Maybe next time I'm back in Phoenix.

I also liked their little coffee shop in the back room, which is separate from the main shopping area, giving you a bit of quiet to read a book or check your email.

Lastly, all the staff are quirky, yet incredibly friendly. They offered up suggestions for local things to do, and were generally helpful.

Of course, this is not to imply that Pie-Zanos is staffed by mouth-breathing ""pizza artists"" or stocked with sub-par ingredients and generally filthy.  On the contrary, this ""Subway of Pizza"" is staffed by congenial and hip 20-30 somethings who are eager to please by heaping  tons of fresh and flavorful ingredients  onto your individual personalized pizza. 

Pie-Zanos allows you to pick from wheat or white dough and from up to 8 different sauces.  From there you can add herbs and crust flavoring and then you can pick from 6-8 different cheeses.  Then you select from the widest selection of pizza toppings you'll find anywhere.   The fare is basically affordable as long as you don't go apeshit on toppings (55 cents each after the first).   As a special bonus they have Pepsi products.   

I have also enjoyed the breadshits which are fresh and delightful and pair nicely with the traditional red marinara as well as the tomato-pesto. 

My only complaints with Pie-Zanos and what keeps it from achieving 5 stars is how busy it gets at lunch, limited indoor seating and the fact that they allow children's birthday parties which, when mixed with ubiquitous bad parenting, quickly turns a hip and snazzy pizza joint into a Chuck-E-Cheese's.",review,8RzsGBVrqLWLCE8sOSYQkw,4,6,1,Female

Here's the problem(s) I have with the venue or CONS so to speak.

1. Cash Only almost EVERYWHERE, for a stadium named after a bank, don't you think someone would have taken finacial practice into better concern, perhaps CHASE just wants to sucker you more by making you pay their ATM fees if your not a member which I see as ""Greedy Fat Cat"" practices. 

2. No real options in regards to ""regular"" ball park food, the Brats are a joke and at 6 bucks a pop, they don't even offer peppers and onions, strange that it shows it in the menu picture. Other than that it's just another typical ""let's capitalize all we can"" with your typical crap chains (Fridays, Panda Express, etc) which I find pretty disgusting.  

3. The ""Value"" beer stands..... Okay, when is a beer a ""value"" at 4 dollars, I mean  seriously, being that I just paid 6 bucks for a brat that's pretty pathetic I'd at least like the decency of having a good size beer to help wash down the piss boiled frank I just overpaid the crap out of for. To sum it up, the value beer is tiny and the only one worth buying IMO is the 9 dollar 24 ouncer or even better, the 10.50 Corona, HA.


Here's the PROS.

1. Damn good deal on seating prices, we sat in section 140 (lower level outfield) for 15 bucks a person, Not too shabby! 

2. The stadium is rather beautiful, for a stadium that is. 

3. There's a pool in the outfield, cool idea 

4. Parking is rather cheap (12 bucks) and has never seemed to be an issue.

5. Traffic control before and after games is surprisingly smooth

1819,wGaFCroINBx3o4L_siYEtw,2011-07-16,sY3Dj0iuUDti4dSVR1L5Kg,4,"Simply put, this place rocks. CleanFreak has a TON of vacuums, a debugging station, and a fast, very efficient car wash. Best of all, for a mere $17 you can have UNLIMITED car washes. If you have windows, you have probably noticed that it is monsoon season, and monsoons hate clean cars as much as terrorists hate freedom. While I cannot explain why we call monsoons 'haboobs' I can tell you CleanFreak is a great place to wash your car.

CleanFreak has some perks I have never seen at other self car washes. For starters, the employees are outstanding. Somehow they are smiling and seem happy- even in the hot summer heat. They great you and explain how things work, and you get an armor all towel, to clean your interior. As you pull around and queue up for a wash, you are then given your choice of air freshener! Where else does that happen at this price?

I highly recommend checking out the unlimited wash VIP fast pass. There is actually a separate line for people with the fast pass, and how it works is a bar-code sticker is placed on your windshield, and you pull up to the fast pass line, and it scans your pass- and you're in- just like that. This 
saves time, and waiting in line, which is good stuff.

The one thing CleanFreak can do a bit better, is communicating how things are supposed to go. On my second visit, I was getting ready to start through the wash, and I asked an employee for an air freshener. He asked me where my receipt was, and I didn't know what he meant. I asked him what receipt and he told me that if you have a Fastpass, you need to bring the recipt that the machine spits out. I had no idea about that, and explained that to him, and he was cool I think it would save some headaches to either have some more signage, or give people a flyer with an overview of what/how to do things. Otherwise, CleanFreak will take care of you, and for the price of one wash somewhere else, you will have a month of unlimited washes.

First things first: they're a little pricey, at first glance. However, their portions are *enormous*. Each of us ordered a full size bowl(Honey Orange Shrimp for me, Jamaican Jerk Kalua Pork for Jamie, Honey Orange Kalua Pork and Teriyaki Chicken for Jamie's parents). The full size bowls were more than enough to last the average person through dinner, and then through lunch the next day; packed full of rice/noodles, meat, and veggies, with each bowl containing a ramekin of sweet teriyaki sauce.

The shrimp in my bowl was perfectly tender and succulent, the Honey Orange sauce sweet, but not cloyingly so. The bowl came with a lime wedge, which added the perfect zing to the mellow coconut ""Rumbi rice"".

We also ordered some of their Bahama Mama's Tortilla Soup, which was a creamy coconut-based broth filled with chunks of grilled chicken, tortilla strips, and melty mozzarella. It was a good, cozy soup, but could have benefited from more depth--some tang, some spice, something.

For dessert, we had some of Rumbi's Key lime pie--moist, rich, and delectably sweet with a lovely measure of sour. Only complaint? The graham cracker crust was too mushy, soft, and crumbly; it would have been much better with a crispy bed under the pillowy-ness of the Key lime filling.

They were quick but thorough with the estimate, and when I brought my car back for the repair, they found some additional hidden damage, contacted the insurance company, secured a promise from them to pay the shop directly (so I didn't have to pay then wait for the insurance company to reimburse me), and still had everything done as promised, when promised, and they called me a few times to update me on the progress.

Let's re-cap 2 of my experiences, shall we?

DINNER:

Arrived shortly after 6 p.m. on a Saturday and sat in the bar area, which was littered with a few patrons. Live music started at 7 p.m. Since Saturday is considered ""All Day Happy Hour,"" I went with a $5 sandwich - turkey, with smoked provolone. On the side, fresh fruit. They call this their ""Half and Half."" The sandwich was okay. Nothing I can't make at my own hacienda, though. I really liked the turkey, which like appeared freshly carved. The beverage: Sam Adams Summer ale, which was their seasonal at the time. 

My family, who dined with me, thought the food was okay. When both my brother and my dad ordered beef, they weren't asked what temperature they wanted it cooked at. They were just given it well done. I would not have stood for that. 

Overall, the food is average ""bar style"" food. The menu is large, though. It may take you several minutes to narrow down your choices. From calzones and burgers to sammies, you have options. 

JUST DRINKS:

Now we're talking. If you're looking for a low-key place to hang for a couple hours, play some pool, watch some sports or hear live music, I would suggest checking out this place. They have two pools tables: one downstairs in the bar area; one upstairs. They also have a video game machine at the bar. (Beware that the pool tables were probably bequeathed to this place. After all, balls disappear. Where did the que ball go? Hmm.)

As for the beer, well... Let's just say they have quite the selection. You may not find your fancy imports here, but you will find some really great beers from some Oregon and Colorado microbrews. For that, this place goes up in rating for me (hence the 4 stars). After all, there's not may low-key places 'round town - especially close to home - that offer quite the array of beers to satiate my discerning tastes. I recommend you try The Great Divide Raspberry Ale, which is made with real raspberries. It's not overly sweet, but it's unique enough that you may find yourself, like me, craving it from time to time. Or, if you enjoy Rogue beer, they do sell the Dead Guy Ale on tap! 

Sure, I list out their beers here, but that'll take up my entire character limit. Let's just say that on their drink menu, THREE WHOLE PAGES are devoted to beer - what you'll find both on tap and by the bottle. 

SO WHY GO? 
Uhm, that's easy. Go for the great beer. (That's the main reason for the 4-star rating.)

If you love good beer, like I do, and want to chill with some friends, while playing pool or listening to some live jams (though the live music stopped at 9 when i went), then check out Boulders on Broadway. You may even find yourself thinking you stumbled through an invisible portal into a 1970's Denver ski lodge. Good times!",review,APLIPfq1Rf8QyhHHk2uAyA,3,4,0,Male

In my search for a really good donut I go to the Internet and Google ""best donuts"" and low and behold Bosa Donuts comes up. They have 3 locations, and the one in Chandler has 12 reviews, which all raved about how great Bosa Donuts were. So I notice they have a location at 35th Ave and Glendale! I had seen it many times but never stopped in thinking it was just the average run of the mill donut shop. Boy was I wrong! 
Bosa Donuts is by far the best donut I have had in a very long time, maybe ever! I stopped by for a dozen this morning and bought a little something special for myself. I got to the car and took one bite and was in heaven. The what I would call a Cinnamon Fry with crumb topping was to die for. What I liked the most was it was not greasy like some other donut shops. (I won't mention any names, you know who you are!) Lightly crisp on the outside and so tender on the inside. The crumb topping was just the icing on the cake. It was all I could do not stop and get some milk so I could utterly devour the rest of my donut on the way to work. I did have a bite of an Apple Fitter after getting to work and it was very yummy too. They have many varieties and some wonderfully looking croissants too.

I did look at some of the bad yelp reviews before going in, which made me nervous! So for those of you that only look at bad reviews, I hope you see this one and have a little more hope.

I had a stylist named Annie, she had pink hair.  Super friendly, and really appeared to want to get my style right.  Since I had read bad reviews before coming in about stylists not listening to the customer when they asked for the curling iron to be used for better curl, I was concerned she would do the same.  But, I let her know I was looking for good curl, and with thin/straight hair, it can be tricky to achieve.  She attempted to curl with just the round brush and hair dryer first, and when she was ""impressed by her curling abilities with a round brush,"" she was ""equally impressed with my hair's inability to hold a curl."" So she broke out the curling iron!

We made great small talk, and I let her know I would be back in a month when I go out to celebrate my birthday.

The salon is a fun, well-decorated environment.  It was pretty loud with the hair dryers going, but not terrible.  The less than perfect rating was that I saw people with mimosas/champagne, and while I had been offered something to drink, I figured I could just choose water or coffee, as that is usually is what at hair salons, I wasn't informed of my choices by the front desk staff.  Now I know for next time to ask for some bubbly!

Another good tip is to plan for longer than 45 minutes if you are planning to do a style with curls.  While I got started on my appointment about 5-10 minutes late, I was there for 1 hour (and I dont have super long, thick hair that takes a great deal of time).

Lucia was Beautiful and sweet, and a pleasure to meet, my lunch, however, was not fit to eat. 

I ordered the THE HUMM-DINGER VEGAN WRAP: Roasted artichoke, zucchini, red bell pepper, onion, fresh spinach and hummus with a balsamic reduction drizzle, with a side of fruit and the sun dried tomato wrap. 

Notice it says ""Roasted"", the cashier told me the Veggies were ""Grilled"". Unfortunately, to my dismay, they were neither. 

Everything inside was heated up, by either stove or microwave, I'd guess the latter, and the ""Sun Dried Tomato Wrap"" was thin, doughy and utterly flavorless, not to mention a shocking pink color, which I'm sure was due to being naturally colored with beet juice, but did not help make things anymore appetizing. The fruit was a soggy pile of your typical pre-cut cantaloupe, honey dew mix. 

It was not what I was expecting AT ALL, when I think of a grilled veggie wrap, I imagine tasting all those veggies bursting with flavor after caramelizing on the grill, they had no flavor though. I also did not expect the temperature to be Hot, chilled would have been better in my opinion if the veggies had actually bee grilled that is. 

This lunch to me was less than average and as I sat there will my full plate in front of me I was asked how my meal was, I clearly stated my concerns as I have here and was simply told that it was a ""Best Seller"". 

Lucia did send over a piece of chocolate cake, which was appreciated, but unfortunately missed the mark since I'm Vegan and the desserts aren't.

I've eaten here for over a decade. I've brought friends, college classmates, relatives, and dates here. I lost my dad 3 years ago and I have fond memories of dining here with him. I distinctly remember spilling a Coke all over myself the first time I brought him here. I also remember coming here on my very last day of law school, with a bunch of classmates from Employment Law. The folks here have seen their share of special occasions in my life. Wouldn't be true if this were truly just a 2 star experience. 

I don't think it's fair to nail a restaurant with a bad review based on only a single visit, in most circumstances. Restaurants are run by humans, who are allowed to have a bad day now and then. I've eaten here a billion times. Occasionally something has annoyed me. Most of the time the service is prompt. And those things are true of every restaurant I've ever frequented more than once. At JOTC, even if it's not prompt, it has not even once been unfriendly. There is an elderly gentleman waiter in particular who I especially like. A non-Indian friend I came here with once asked him, ""So, what part of India are you from?"" The waiter look back puzzled and said in his typically mild and hushed manner, ""Sir, I am from Mexico City."" We LOL'd. 

It's #2 on my list of Indian restaurants in the Valley, which is pretty good. Since Tandoori Times is so close by it almost always wins out on a given night, over the past year or so. But the fact remains that JOTC is solidly #2. 

The food is good, by my Indian standards. Samosas: awesome. Chicken tikka masala: very good. I tried the bhindi masala once and that didn't turn out too well. A unique JOTC feature is that dishes are served in very cute, traditional-looking, brass or copper Indian pots. 

Little details like that lead me to say that the decor and atmosphere here probably beat out Tandoori Times and every other Indian place. Simple but elegant, with old Indian art on the walls and cool room dividers thoughtfully placed throughout. The outdoor seating is very pleasant, with heaters to warm you up during winter. The location only adds to the reason to eat here. It's in a cool space next to the Scottsdale Civic Center, a few yards away from AZ 88. It's a solid place to come with a group to eat, drink, and enjoy some good conversation.

JOTC doesn't blow me away (thus only 4 stars), but it needs to be said that if you live in the Valley it is worth at least one visit if you like Indian food, which you wouldn't be able to tell from the other reviews. Judge for yourself.",review,17PPxx8RxjOUD_nQZ1aHEw,1,3,0,Male

Out of the many shows I have attended here, there have been frequent issues with the sound system...disappointing when you are sitting further than 5 rows from the stage. 

However, being that this is the only stage in AZ that houses big traveling productions, I can't complain too much and will continue to be a patron here. Looking forward to the rest of this season!",review,sPEFql7fLp0oouFxnooGpQ,1,0,0,Male

I'm not an Indian food expert, but I am a serious enthusiast and I've eaten at dozens of Indian places on three continents, not to mention my family being from the vicinity of that area of the world and therefore having grown up on curry and rice and all things spice.

We went here for lunch yesterday (Sunday), thanks to a Yelp/Aloqa recommendation after we'd had a romp at Estrella Mountain Park and were starving. The place was almost deserted at 1pm, with only one other table occupied - fair enough. We went for the buffet. And I have to say, it was simply ""okay"". The buffet didn't have a particularly wide variety of stuff - several items were cheap regulars such as the saag and the dhal - spinach and lentils for the uninitiated. They did have aloo zucchini, never seen that before - tasted okay, about as good as I'd have been able to make it (and that's actually not a compliment). No lamb dishes - disappointing, but unfortunately this is also rare.

Flavorwise, I found it boring and unspectacular. Saag is saag, tandoori chicken is tandoori chicken, except their chicken was very light on the tandoori smoke flavour. None of the food left the slight zing on my tongue that it should have. Rice was okay, but then you typically can't go wrong with cooking basmati (although another reviewer's mileage apparently differed on this count). We had our almost-3-year-old along and he did have a little rice, chicken and beef - it was his first real curry and thus a pretty substantial milestone for us. Then the wife went to get a little kheer and a gulab jamun ball. The kheer was watery but tasted okay - compared unfavourably to the sabudaana kheer at India Palace. The jamun ball was almost completely solid - you had to press real hard with a fork to cut it, normally they're nice and soft and soaked. However, another one I got was normal - so it was just the luck of the draw there. Beef curry was nice, although the first piece I ate was mainly fat - whatever, you get that and I don't mind it. The fried pakoras can normally be cut through with a fork. These you had to saw through with a knife - not great, chewy to the point of almost being crunchy. No samosas in the buffet. The naan was unusual. I've had a LOT of naan before and this stuff was the uncommon kind, not thick and pita-ey but instead a little more like a roti. It tasted very fresh - we had plain and also garlic - and the wife really liked it. Kid did too. I personally prefer the other sort of naan - softer and a little more substance to it, but this one had merit regardless. However, it took at least fifteen minutes after our food was served before the naan arrived.

All up, middle of the road as far as I'm concerned, although the wife quite liked it. Note that this is for the buffet only - we did not have a-la-carte and perhaps the to-order cooked food may have tasted better. I've had better buffets - the best one in Phoenix west of the 17 IMO is India Palace - a wider variety, a lot busier (as a result, I'm sure) and more flavourful food. Admittedly, I haven't tried any other Indian places south of Bell but west of the 17 except for Sutra. Bell appears to have most of them?

I would normally have given this place a flat three stars, but I'm going to give it an extra half and round up for a few reasons. Firstly, the waiter was real nice and very attentive - up to the standard of a typical US chain place, rather than the silent wanderers with the Easter Island statue facial expressions at other buffets who do no more than refill your water and clear your dirty dishes every fifteen minutes or so. He was asking us how we were doing, offered refills of my wife's iced tea at appropriate times etc. Spot on. Next, there's a buffet discount where all kids under 10 are $5 - however, we noticed that they appropriately knocked the price down to $3.50 for us, unbidden and I guess for the simple reason that he was set up in a high chair and obviously only ate 1/4 of a breakfast bowl worth of food in total. Third, the place had nice decor (although I was a bit concerned there were no tablecloths, with my kid banging his plastic sippy cup and spilling sh1t all over the tabletop) and thankfully they didn't have sh1tapple wudda-wudda-waa-waa pretentious bhangra muzak playing in a cheap attempt at making you feel like you're actually in India.

I'd eat here again, but only if I'm in the area and DYING for Indian food. It simply didn't measure up, either buffet-wise or flavour-wise. For first-timers, I can see how they would have enjoyed the experience - clean seating area, Americanized flavours and a good waiter. My experience, however, has been burned in over almost four decades and I've kicked the tyres of more cuisines from this area of the world than I can recount, especially Indian.

Our order wasn't right but couldn't get the server to come back so we just let it go.  The food was great!  Had a few items from the small plates and then we had the bacon grilled cheese and the chicken sandwich.  Both very good.

Service was fast and friendly, we never ran out of beer.  I got the BLT on Sourdough, and so did my friend, her husband got the Black and Blue Burger.

Tons of crispy bacon, and they cut it so that you were able to eat the sandwich without bacon attacking you.  The sourdough bread was thick cut and lightly toasted.

The burger was a little less than we expected - 2 nice size patties, but the blue cheese could have been done a little better, and it was very messy.  The onion rings were nice sized and with great, fluffy breading on them.

Nicely seasoned and prepared fresh branzino sat on top of ribbon cut caponata, an unusual surprise was the vinaigrette and the ribbon cut string less celery that was very good.

Since we skipped the interesting desserts last time we had to try one this time and tried the chocolate hazelnut cake with jam-figs and mascarpone gelato this dessert was garnished with a chocolate sort of lavender crisp and roasted hazelnuts.

So no, Boombozz is definitely not the best pizza that I've ever had, but for their style of pizza, they are pretty good. Think traditional Domino's/Papa John's type crust with stepped-up, unique toppings and sauce. My husband said the crust tasted like a cheesy breadstick, and I think that's a pretty accurate description. We got the D'Sienna with an interesting tomato cream sauce, spinach, and tomatoes.

She assured me it would not be ""much"". It was $60 and she hardly did a thing, can't even steam it there. I was irate but calmly asked her if she could charge less and she screamed NO! She said it's because the dress cost more. Yeah...like that matters A guy was there dropping off pants that needed taken OUT which is a lot more work, she charge him $18.50 for each pair. I don't know if that is good for pants a lot but her pricing scale seems way off!

Previously I've been to 5th Avenue Alterations and they charge me $50 for a floor length brdiesmaid dress that they took in the whole thing AND steamed it. They're also polite and will work with you on pricing and communicate with you beforehand. Definitely worth the few extra minutes of a drive!!",review,q3gDMyDku0ihp0MDzXOcPA,0,1,0,Female

Show up at the store, where there are a few people on the ""patio"" happily chowing down on what looks to be some tasty grub.  Once I walk inside, I feel the warm, home-owned vibe that makes my tummy smile.  I pay my dues (under $6.50 with tax minus tip), wait 6 minutes, and voila! the pizza is ready.  

Armed with crushed red pepper and fresh parmesan from the restaurant, I dig in when I return to my office, savoring each pepperoni-and-cheese covered bite.  This is not the best pizza I've had; however, I can't imagine a 10 carb pizza being any better.  Crispy, thin, wheat crust, flavorful ingredients, and a short drive from work?  Wow!  

I will return, and may upgrade my already high rating!",review,XRjmRSO4XhkUVMKVJOSEIA,0,0,0,Male

1899,1oFvqm7eSpJbVpxpPxueaA,2008-01-09,QMU906B86pFCpp4lOUOteg,1,"Buca Di Beppo is literally, italian restaurant hell. You know how all big box chain restaurants throw junk up on the walls in an attempt to make the space feel vintage? Buca Di Beppo throws junk, and knick knacks and statues and anything else 'italian' they could find in the chinese warehouse where they loaded up these goods. It's a terrible horrible mess and you end up sitting in a yardsale of italian paraphenalia while eating your very bland pasta.


It's embarassing how truly flavorless the food is here. Thin, flavorless alfredo sauce. Thick slabs of lasagna with less taste than what I can get out of the frozen section at Publix. I went with a large group and across the table, bland food.

When they seat your party, they guide you through the kitchen area where the cooks play along and say a welcoming hello. Deep down you know they hate this. Why are we in the kitchen? Sure it's nice, but I'd rather have them concentrating on making the food, and making it good. Of course, the food at Buca Di Beppo seems to be far beyond any point of return to tasting good. It's just dead. Dead food. No life, no flavor, not emotion. I get more flavor from the $.99 Michelina's frozen lunch package.

Far from claiming anything authentic Italian, Buca Di Beppo even pumps out bread with no taste. Eating at Buca is like eating food from an assisted living facility. No salt, no sugar, no butter, no fat, it's all gone along with anything resembling taste. Sure, Buca has huge portions, and the setup is nice for large parties and families - but they might as well just buy the family-size pasta packs from the frozen section and bake it at home, even that would be better, and they wouldn't have to the mandatory gratuity. Say what you will about other italian chains like Macaroni Grill, or Olive Garden - at least their food taste like something.",review,SbzANP6hRVwDU5pbtz5ANw,7,6,14,Female
