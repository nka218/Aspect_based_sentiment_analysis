They also have these ""bowls"" which look so enticing! Consists of fruit, granola, acai, honey etc. they have a few different  kinds but they look so good for being healthy for ypu :). Honestly, i think they have maybe more to offer than Jamba does. I had the Pina-cool-ada, and i feel in love with it. They break down the calories of each drink depending which size cup you get also. I'm all about information at my fingertips and they had everything I needed/wanted to know laid out nicely.  You get a free boost as well.. fat burner, energy etc. They also serve different kinds of pretzels as well. 

It was my first visit here so forgive me because i know i am leaving some things off...but this goes to show you the menu is extensive cause I damn sure cannot remember all of it.

After two years of getting our date on at places like Postino's, St. Francis, the Rokerij, Dick's Hideaway, and Padre's, we decided we needed a Tempe date place. Friday night we decided to check out La Bocca.

In short. it's okay. Nice environment, good service, pretty good pizza, and great ice cream flight for dessert. But this is tempered with over priced wine (almost $20 for two glasses of HOUSE wine?), small pieces of bruschetta (tasty - scratch that - REALLY tasty, but the slices are teeny tiny), and it's on Mill, so most of the other patrons are frat guys trying to impress sorority sisters, and if you're lucky, you'll get to see a couple of Greeks making out. Yum? There was a table of older people tucked into a corner who didn't seem to mind the age gap, but in my late-20s, I was not very much amused.

The good service, cool atmosphere, tasty bruschetta choices, and creative, thin crust pizza get this place three stars. The over priced wine and bruschetta (seriously, we usually get bruschetta at Postino's for the same price for 4 people, and then I am too full to order dinner, but at La Bocca I was ready for round two after my half of the plate), and the fact that it's on Mill keeps it from 5 stars.

They serve bento boxes (basically a lunch box with rice, your choice of entree, salad and slices of oranges--a healthy dessert!) for $3.75.  If you're feeling like a high roller, you can order the sashimi bento box, and that will set you back a whopping $6.

Short Review:

THIS PLACE SUCKS BALLS

Long Review:
We were supposed to meet a friend here at Draft House on Saturday night. We were excited to be out on a date-like experience cuz its been a while. We went to my in-laws for dinner and then headed to Draft... I knew it was going to be interesting from the sound of the music as we pulled into the strip mall. 

The music: Good music, probably the only good thing about this place - if you're a hip-hop fan. All hip-hop, all night. 

The crowd: Ghetto fab all the way! Seems like everyone there is late 20's - early 30's (and some older sprinkled throughout the crowd) and none realize its not 1996 anymore. Expect to hear a lot of fake accents a la Da Bronx and a lot of misuse of slang terms. It was entertaining until it became annoying. Oh and people WILL steal your seats or tell you they are saved - ugh!

The atmosphere: small, crowded...  Small dance floor.  A couple pool tables, but don't expect to get one. Some TVs playing various sports, which I guess qualifies this place as a ""sports cafe""?? 

The service: OMG, we had one beer each and the ""line"" was retarded, over 30 minutes to tab out. No line in sight, just people crowding together, trying to get to the front of the line.  Oh! and LOL.. the bar tenders are total morons, one of them complained to the guy next to us about his crappy tip and the other argued with his customer about whether they ordered rum and cokes or redbull and vodka.  The guy had already made the rum and cokes and was pissed that HE got it wrong.  Weirdos!

If any of this appeals to you this is your place! 

BTW her friend didn't show and we ended up going to Skip n Jan's to play some pool :o)  We had a great time there :o)",review,VBKbZD9X4zruXYORIhJhhg,3,6,4,Female

It looks like some of my coworkers got the sausage sandwich and the steak sandwich and one person got a pasta dish and couldn't even eat a quarter of it because they gave so much.

1024,Kau5iJl6VR-TJ20YGrL7MQ,2009-02-07,tB1RGzfF-wpGSA_6pXH88A,2,"I needed an oil change reeeeaaaally badly (i know, but i have a honda and those things can run on gas fumes for 30 miles and oil resin for months) and had had an OK experience at the danny's family on HIghland (free wash with a oil change, who doesn't love that?)

But. I checked the Danny's site and saw no promotion of the wash and didn't want to drive out of my way for nothing. i checked yelp and this Jiffy Lube had the best rating i could expect for an oil change place and was up the road from work. Downloaded the coupon (thanks for the tip, Kym) and was on my way.

Pull in and i tell the guy i want the ""Signature"" change which includes window wash and floor vacuum, mentioning my $5 off coupon. He said that they were already running a special that was $13 off the $35 price so i said a-ok, cowboy. 

i wait for about 8-10 minutes in the small waiting room (bonus for having a Phoenix Magazine in the stack of Muscle Car Monthly, Oil Today and Antennas Weekly - look, just because i'm getting routine maintenance on my car does not mean i'm INTO cars).

I get pulled into the garage area for the ""spiel"" everybody dreads but it was surprisingly short and non-pushy. (i'm glad they don't drag you over to your engine anymore, that's totally lame). i do have to note that he tried to tell me my right front blinker, my left back blinker and my license plate lights were out. i had JUST gone to Checker to replace my left front blinker light and went through some extensive light checking and so found this news odd. i kept saying as much, and he kept insisting and i was about to ask to see for myself when he calls out to another worker ""Hey, was that the honda with the lights or the jeep?"" the other guy says ""the jeep."" however, there was no other car in the place. hmmmmmmmm.

OK, so i pay up ($24 altogether with a tax or fee or something added in) and go back into the waiting area while they finish up. I decide to use the bathroom -- and this is where the they lost two stars (this was, up until then, quite possibly a four-star experience - wait, two stars for a bathroom, you ask? oh, you just wait...)

the bathroom was filthiest thing i have seen in my life, and i've been to some raunch truck stop pee holes. literally, piss, in the bowl... i get in closer and i shit you not (pun intended) four shit smears in the bowl as well (yeah, i counted). two rolls of TP hanging out on top of the dispenser, each with one square left on them. realizing i need to sterilize my hands from just walking into this mess, i discover no soap or paper towels (not very surprising). as well, hair clippings all over the sink, like the guys are trimming their moustaches on their break. un-freaking-believable. i am still haunted by this bathroom experience.

1025,W7xb2iS4cYL14Yi5LOGSkA,2012-07-20,mYQUMTcBhBp_NTaj7gQr8Q,1,"I will precede this lackluster review by stating the following:

1)I have only been to this place once.
2)I didn't get a chance to actually try the cuisine.
3)I am a sympathetic person to servers, as I have been one.

That being said, I give this place one star for reasons of poor service.

About six months ago, at around 4pm on a Sunday afternoon, we decided to eat at this place. The atmosphere was warm and cozy; typical college bar with college-aged waitresses.

We made sandwich selections and ordered happy hour beers. The beers came, the food never did, and we watched other patrons come in, eat, and leave.  All the while, our waitress never came by to give us an explanation or even get us another round of drinks (we got them ourselves from the bar). 

Since my bf and I both worked in food service, we are always sympathetic when we can see that a place is under-staffed.  But after an hour of waiting, we finally crossed the room to speak with our server. She said, ""I can't imagine it will be much longer."" I think the more professional approach would have been an apology and admitting to forgetting to put in our ticket, which is what we gathered when we saw her speaking frantically with the cook.

Where was the manager that day? Or someone who noticed that we sat there so long without our food or any communication at all?

We left money on the table for our beers and walked out. I guess there is a first time for everything.",review,YnuPa08WRFw_VYQsb3rcoA,0,2,0,Female
1026,WSHQ9qpL39g5xA3E5iBCmw,2011-10-09,HwZKlZ4F3RH3adez4cC4FA,5,"As I passed the velvet rope flanked by shiny, exotic cars I knew I was in for an experience.  Some might call it a fine-dining experience, but clearly this was something more.  A tribute to opulence and Regan-era excess, Dominick's is your seven-figure foodie fantasy come alive; from the moment you enter the swanky foyer to the gleaming 10 inch tower of tiramisu that finishes your meal.  It's glittery, bedazzled, and oozing pretension - and I loved it.

The Service
My visit to Dominick's was the night after it's official opening.  The service tried very hard to be as impeccable as the surroundings and, while not perfect, the charming staff and the sincere effort put forth made little things like missing napkins and bread plates instantly forgivable.  Our server, Drew, let us know that the wait staff only had 2 - 3 tables each and it was very evident in the personal service we received.  A few more weeks of experience for the staff should easily iron out the little wrinkles.

The Food
We started with the jumbo shrimp appetizer, which unfortunately came with 3 shrimp - hardly conducive to sharing - so we ordered two. And ""Jumbo"" they certainly were, accompanied by a kicky cocktail sauce which my dinner companion felt was spicy enough.  Ever the daredevil, I added additional horseradish to mine because who doesn't like to burn the inside of their nostrils at dinner.
For the main course we both had the 9-oz filet, lobster gnocchi and steamed asparagus.  My filet was a perfect rare-plus with a dark pink center, expertly seared and juicy.
Surprisingly the lobster gnocchi really stole the show for me.  I'm not big on starches or cream sauces so when it was suggested I wasn't particularly excited; I should have been.  The dough was light and fluffy, the cream sauce not too rich and the lobster added the perfect amount of salt & texture.
After dinner I indulged in a grand marnier while my companion ordered the tiramisu.  He was presented with a 10 inch tall hunk of cake that could easily have been intended for 4 people.  The tiramisu was spongy and light, with a lovely cool custard and only a subtle flavor of rum.  A nice finish to an excellent meal.  

Atmosphere
We were lucky enough to score a poolside table which started off as very romantic but over the course of the evening became quite the place for people watching.  The scene at the small bar area on the 2nd floor was bustling and both the waiters and I wondered aloud how long it would be before a guest fell in the pool.

I also agree with some of the others. I love the fact that I can try something new without committing! I love the revolving sushi. I also do not like that there are a lot of spicy selections. Why not offer the spice on the side. I would love some of the sushi, but it has that spicy sauce on it.

Sapporo - Can it ever be bad?  It was served very cold.  Thumbs up.
Green Tea - Good.  Good service on the refills also.
Edamame - Good.  Right amount of salt.
Miso - Interesting wooden bowl and wooden spoon.  It tasted good, tho.
Yellow Tail, Salmon, Tuna, Albacore, Uni, FW Eel,  Kampachi nigiri.  Good stuff on all of those.  They also have ""Yasu style"" nigiri for some types, and they are good.  It usually involves ponzu on top.
Spicy Tuna and Softshell Crab roll.  SSC was great!

Service was pretty good and sushi was also good.  The bar was full but I wish I could have eaten there.  The sushi chefs were friendly and talkative to the people at the bar, which is unusual (at least compared to LA).

There are some elevation changes and some bunkering that add some challenge, but overall it's a pretty easy course.

Some of the better holes are #5, a dogleg right with no room to drive it left (slopes into a hazard), and large green with some tricky pin positions if the flag is in the back.  #8 is a long par four with a narrow driving area and a challenging approach featuring a narrow chute to the green that will most likely need to be hit with a mid-to-long iron (#1 handicap).  #11 is a par 5 that forces you consider fairway metal off the tee, as a driver hit over 260 yds and to the right could likely find a water hazard, and anything left is completely dead.  My personal favorite hole is #18, a short four par with a carry over a ravine from the tee to an uphill, dogleg left fairway with a slope on the left side and a reachable fairway bunker.  

Most of the greens here are fairly large, so lag putting will come into play.  There aren't any tricks here - it can suit fairway-green style and the bomb-and-gouge crowd.

Daytime:
The pool is always jam packed with a fairly disgusting crowd and the dudes out number the babes by a 3 to 1 count I'd say. That's no fun. Oh, and by dudes, I mean douche bags. And Babes? More like gross skanks covered in makeup at the pool. Ok, I guess I'm being a hater, but spend a few hours here and you might be kind of disgusted with the scene too. It's just really amateur hour here with the piss poor service and their bad attitudes and obnoxious patrons. The only reason I came was because a friend likes to stay at the W when visiting and he too noted the quality of this place has declined over the years. He has stayed at four different W locations (NY, South Beach, Westwood) and said this one is the ""worst and trashiest"". It took an hour before any waitress came over to ask if we wanted any drinks or food. When started to get service it was always a long wait for our pitcher of margaritas or buckets of beer and food. Speaking of the food, the fries, fish tacos and club sandwich are all great. The grilled cheese, not so much. The first $42 pitcher of margaritas was weak, hardly tasting any alcohol. The second pitcher was stronger. To be fair, the Saturday service was much better.

Nighttime:
Much improved scene, but still not great. There are a lot of out-of-towners since it is a hotel, but still plenty of locals too. I think it's a good mixture. Pants and collared shirts are required, so that usually gets rid of most of the tank top, neck tat wannabes from earlier in the day at the pool.  But really, you are just trading one group of wannabes for another. Man, I'm a hater huh? Oh well, you can handle it. Drinks are overpriced, but this is the W. Be ready to spend lots o' cash.

Let me be clear. I 'm reviewing Haji Baba as a GROCERY STORE first.  Then I will give you some insight into the prepared food for take-out or in-store dining.

This is one of the few stores in Arizona where you have several choices for pita bread--it's also the ONLY place I've found for whole wheat pita.
There are several choices for Feta cheese. Danish, French,Greek...same with olives--there are choices.
I ALWAYS buy my tahini here. All the prices are very inexpensive.

Need spices???  They have them all.  At about 25% of the price you would pay anywhere else.
The best way to describe Haji Baba is that it is a REAL grocery store, with REAL prices, for REAL people.  It is NOT a ""specialty store"" with trendy items and inflated prices.  They sell food items that you will actually use.  The bonus here?  You won't find a 10 year old can or jar of something.

On to the ""restaurant"" portion.  Haji Baba is better if you think of it as a take-out joint that happens to have places to sit and eat.  They do have tables and they do perform table service, it's just got zero charm.  You go for the food, that's it.

Okay, food.  The lamb tongue sandwich is to die for.  Let me repeat.  The LAMB TONGUE PITA SANDWICH.  GET IT!  Their baba ganouj is also darned tootin' tasty.  Actually, I sometimes dream about their baba ganouj.
I'm not crazy about their hummus, maybe because making hummus takes 5 minutes and mine is bomb? But it's not bad.
Gyros are good and not greasy. Greasy gyro meat is a pet peeve of mine.
Chicken shwarma?  Yup, that's good too.

I asked about memberships and then he said, ""Sorry we are sold out"". I stood there stunned. Then he snickered, ""Just kidding"". Trying to be a good sport I went with it. 

Next came the young sales guy. He was personable - at first anyways. Showed me around the gym and I was interested in joining. Next we went over to the childcare area since I have a little one. Children were in the room however the two girls monitoring the room were chatting it up with one another and ignoring the kids. Bad sign. I asked the girls if they were CPR certified and had fingerprinting and background checks. The world stopped for just a moment and they stared at me. I had interrupted their important conversation. Then they were both saying, ""Yeah, like, well, um, no, I mean yes,"". In other words, no straight answers. 

We sat at the sales guy's desk and the wheeling and dealing began. I felt like I was purchasing a new car. ""If you choose option A, you then can go to all the gyms.""

So of course the container store would have something as silly as a hot dog container to hold the rest of your package.

Add ""beefy"" and you've pretty much summed up your 5GB&F  experience!

After detoxing this morning, I was really hungry...after all, I'm a pretty big and bouncy boy and when you lug this kind of tonnage up and down the canal, you're going to need some retoxing!

And since it's Taco Tuesday, I thought a burger fest sounded about right!

I needed to be up north anyway, so I texted my order (what a time and vexation saver that is!...two stars for 5GB&F right there) and it was ready, hot and juicy when I rolled in.

The burgers and fries remind me of nothing so much as Wendy's of about 30 years ago...you know, when Wendy's was actually pretty good (not like now when, they consistently screw up your order and figuratively, literally throw your bag-o-food into your car as you idle by the pickup window).

The burgers are OK, the fries are fresh and peanutty (no, really...fresh peanut oil...the fries taste peanutty!), and the Coke is, well, Cokey. 

The atmosphere is nice enough, all red and white checked and tons of ""look at me"" crap on the walls (""Best Fries in Hoboken!"")

The music was also reasonably pleasant (Men at Work...""I come from a land down under""...I shuddered a little bit at the part ""and men chunder""...please, no chundering while I'm eating!).

Anyway...

I was able to purchase this little repast for a mere $11.83 (I saved a little by having the small fries).

I know, Grind or Delux prices for a retro Wendy's burger!

I'm no spendthrift, but I could feed a family of 6 at In-n-Out for $12...and with better burgers.

But, 5GB&F filled me up, they had my burger ready to roll and they very nicely didn't mess up my order (but then again, how could they screw it up...they were ordered to prepare my burger by a computer...we know what happens when you don't do what a computer tells you...you ""accidentally"" ride over a cliff on your Segway, that's what happens!)

 And, in a nostalgic sort of way, they reminded me of how Wendy's used to be (complete with 70's music), and for that, a reasonable 3.25 stars.",review,du6KeE54IFbPiXpU3LOd1g,10,10,11,Male

Personally, one of my favorite activities is to start here for coffee and take a walking tour in the area. It's one of the few neighborhoods in Phoenix with historic homes from the 1920s, which seem to be untouched by the authoritarian overlords of homeowner's associations so popular in suburbs. I could be wrong, as I don't live in the area.

They also have so many options to hang by a pool, including a private spa mineral pool (sans children). We understand there is a great kids pool also. The food was delicious at their restaurant also.

We did not experience any construction issues (as they may be finished), but we certainly benefited from all their efforts. It is beautifully appointed and plenty of spaces that feel private. It is not a convention-like hotel, but I have heard (from a corporate event planner) they do a wonderful job for large parties. 

Everyone from the valet, to registration, housekeeping and wait staff were more than accommodating and very friendly.

While in my personal experience at Posh, the quality (and ""deliciousness"") of the food I had definitely justifies the price-tag, it should - if the quality wasn't extraordinary, it wouldn't rank at all.

You really do have to be an open-minded, mostly omnivorous eater to fully appreciate it though.  If there are ingredients or flavors that you don't much care for, it might be more challenging to assume that you will like everything you get.  

It can be daunting, because you may get something that you don't like, but that is also part of the excitement (and the adventure of trying new things!)  You also may get something that you've never had done well before and find that you are a newly converted fan.  

Also, though the wine parings are wonderful, if you are on a budget, skipping the wine is a good way to trim the bill.

The Bar: What a lovely, refreshing Basil margarita!  It was just sweet enough without being syrupy.  But bartender, why is getting a recommendation out of you like pulling teeth?

The Food: Excellent table-side guacamole; it lived up to the very high expectations set by all the other reviewers.  My dinner partner's Hangar Steak was very juicy for such a thin cut and the dressing from the tomatillo salad give the whole dish a tangy, acidic bite.  My Chorizo Porchetta was very unique and flavorful, but a little more sauce would've saved it from being slightly dry.  I love though how the star of the entrees really is the meat here, the portions were generous and the sides were an accompaniment, not a competitor.
***Almost forgot about the pumpkin bread pudding we shared!  He loved the scotch-carmel sauce which I thought was too sweet.  I loved the moist, fragrant bread which he thought was missing pumpkin-y spice.  To each their own!

The Atmosphere:  It's a gothic romance come to life with beautiful dark metal chandeliers, warm, glowing salt bricks, and dim lighting.  I just wish the table of 6 old men talking golf wasn't sooo close.  A little more room between tables would complete the intimate decor.

The Service:  I have no complaints here!  Our server was excellent and never overwhelming, the lady who made our guac was all charm, and kudos to the chef who sent us complimentary street corn (yummy by the way).  

A note on the street corn: I felt like this was a dish that would've won the Top Chef competition where they had to re-invent convenience store food.  The grilled, slightly salty & crunchy corn topped with creamy spicy cheese sauce beats any AM-PM nachos I've ever had! :)

We'll start with the coffee: traditional espresso macchiato. No microfoam, large bubbles in the milk, too hot to drink right away. The shot was good, but by the time it was cool enough to drink had lost quite a bit of flavor.

Very friendly service, on the other hand. Given that Phoenix-foam tends to be subpar, I tend to think that service and atmosphere are almost more viable measures for successful coffeeshops than coffee. (in Phoenix) 

The actual place was pretty odd. Large paintings of Mexican sugar skulls in the back, nice chairs and tables, an orange faux-finish on the walls... And then the video bar element. Three huge flatscreens on the wall playing pop music videos from the '90s. Very strange, in my opinion.

All of the prices on the menu looked very reasonable for the portion.",review,iC7NVBmkzRl4rKEU5MWS0A,0,0,0,Female

Too bad the baristas remember my fiancé but not me, even though we always come in together. Pfft.

But that's okay. I can take solace in their georgia peach tea and gluten-free/vegan english muffin. Toasted with just the right preserves, it makes my belly happy. I cheated on my diet but that's okay. Just don't tell my doctor.

I have always been a fan of their food. I did knock this down to 4 stars because they seem to have dumped a lot of the vegan/gluten-free options they used to have. Super sad face.

Also, there was a very loud man in there asking for money, yesterday. But he quickly left. Loud conversation is very distracting. It is not the quietest coffee shop if there are many people, but it is still nice!",review,SJoMGpnY0DVtMlpjFK78-Q,0,0,0,Male

The chicken pinwheels that were supposedly featured on the Food Network or something are phenomenal.  There's a good variety of entrees featuring different types of seafood and meat, and plenty of southwest flavors.  The margaritas, served with a little shaker of extra, are excellent too.  My mom actually drank a whole one, which, maybe you don't know my mom, but, trust me, is saying something.  The ambiance out on the patio (when it's not too hot outside) is quite comfortable and cozy, with the fountain and the strings of lights.  Also, they have homemade flavored tortillas, with different flavors featured daily, but sometimes the waitstaff doesn't seem overly eager to give them out.  Had to deduct one star for service.  Other than that, I highly recommend this place.",review,YL8SKv-pwx-Wj9cwGYrn3g,0,0,0,Female

Even though they are new, these things are fixable so hopefully the feedback will be taken in the appropriate vein. The building is very cool and the vibe was energetic on a sunny Sunday morning. There was an abundance of waiters but they seemed to be confused and frenetic without a real focus on the customer. The menu is very limited and our server had not eaten most of the items. He was struggling to explain. Our drinks took more than 15 minutes to arrive even though we saw them sitting at the bar for the entire time. Our water had just disappeared. Then the food. I ordered the grill cheese ( a rare treat and when I order it I want it good!). It was cold and overwhelmed by heavy bread. The cheese wasn't melted. I sent it back and they simply nuked it and brought it out. Icky. Our son wanted a kids cheeseburger and the staff kept coming back and forth not sure if there was a single burger or sliders for kids. It became comical after the third person came out. My husband ordered a salmon omelet with several additional fixings. The eggs tasted like box eggs and it was lackluster and flavorless. We even took the time to provide feedback to management but we got a weak smile and ""come back and try us again."" He made no effort to ""make things right"" either by comping something else to taste or providing an incentive to come back. There are too many restaurants in town to have to go to one that is less than mediocre. The young crowd may enjoy it for the bar vibe it gives but the majority of the tables on Sunday am were families or middle aged and we saw similar responses at other tables.",review,U4j1MmMVZlts04OZxz87SA,0,7,0,Female
